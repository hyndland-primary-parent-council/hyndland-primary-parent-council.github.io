Hyndland Mums on the Run began in September 2013 when twelve Hyndland mums decided to get together and run a sponsored 5k race to raise money for sports and outdoor equipment for the school. We now have many runners (from beginners to half marathon racers), a qualified running coach and are affiliated to Jog Scotland. Our aim is to get Hyndland mums running and to feel all the benefits that running in a sociable group can bring: support, camaraderie, fitness and the happiness that only a post-run coffee and cake can bring.

We currently meet at 7pm every Wednesday evening. If you’re interested in joining us, contact Louise at [hyndlandmotr@gmail.com](mailto:hyndlandmotr@gmail.com).&nbsp; **Because of coronavirus restrictions, you _must_ contact us before joining a run**.

Don’t wait to get fit to join – join us and get fit.
