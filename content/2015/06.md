# Hyndland Primary Parent Council

### Parent Noticeboard

# [Happy Holidays!](news/happy-holidays/)

From all of the parents on the Parent Council, we hope that you have a great summer break and we look forward to seeing you in August. Except of course for those parents whose youngest child is about to leave Hyndland Primary School – in which case so long and best wishes!

# [Another year’s end is drawing near…](news/another-years-end-is-drawing-near/)

It has been another great year of learning and teaching and productive activity and development for the children at Hyndland Primary School. They have experienced an engaging curriculum in line with the aims, principles and the four capacities of Curriculum for Excellence – to be successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens. Our […]

# [Your Parent Council Needs You!](news/your-parent-council-needs-you/)

Hyndland Primary School Parent Council is only as good as the support and involvement of those who contribute to it and the work of the wider Parent Forum. We are always looking for as wide a level of engagement with the Parent Council as possible, so please do approach Parent Council representatives with your comments, […]

# [Parent Council Fundraising](news/parent-council-fundraising-2/)

This year the Parent Council has been – as always – finding ways to actively raise funds in order to support the school, by purchasing a range of resources to help enrich the children’s learning experiences. Over the 2014-15 school year you have all helped us raise almost £2,000, with £10,000 being spent this year […]

# [School Building Project 4Rs](news/school-building-project-4rs/)

We had all hoped that the delayed building work commencement from January this year would begin at least at the start of the summer break. However, while work is currently underway on repairing the roof on the extension to fix the multitude of leaks, other work is planned to start in the main building, but […]

# [Mums on the Run](news/mums-on-the-run-7/)

MOTR has so far raised almost £2000 for sport and outdoor activities at Hyndland. This year many families from school took part in ‘Five Go Running’. The event aimed to get more people out running, at the same time as raising funds to send all our classes to use the world class athletics facilities at […]

# [Parent Council Quiz Night](past-events/parent-council-quiz-night/)

On Saturday 30 May we had another fun night challenging the old grey matter during the Quiz Night fundraiser at Hyndland Bowling Club. While it was not as well attended as we had hoped, due to some great prizes on offer in the raffle we still managed to raise £280 profit after all of the […]

# [Thank you to everyone who helped with the Spring Clean](past-events/thank-you-to-everyone-who-helped-with-the-spring-clean/)

Thank you to everyone who helped with the Spring Clean! After some confusing messages from the City Council, we eventually managed to get our annual Spring Clean off the ground on Sunday 31 May 2015. As usual we had a pretty good turnout of parents, pupils and teachers who turned up in their best casual […]
