# Fundraising

The Parent Councilâ€™s Fundraising Committee organises several social events throughout the school year in order to get everyone together, make friends and collect funds to help the school.

The Fundraising Team always appreciates more volunteers&nbsp;to help with the events! If you would like to give us a hand and support the school at the same time, please [email](mailto:enquiries@hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org)&nbsp;us.

Any help or input, big or small, is very welcome!
