# Five Go Running

[November 7, 2014](/news/five-go-running-2/) [admin](author/admin/)

A big thanks to those mums, dads, grannies, aunties, uncles and pals who took part in Five Go Running. A&nbsp; **HUGE** thanks to those children from school who took part in fundraising runs. Brilliant effort all round!

As of 3 November, Â£593.73 has been raised through online and cash donations, all of which will go towards hiring coaches to take our children to use the excellent Commonwealth sports facilities.

**Thank you to everyone who sponsored Mums on the Run.**
