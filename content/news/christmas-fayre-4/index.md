# Christmas Fayre

[December 12, 2013](/news/christmas-fayre-4/) [admin](author/admin/)

**Friday 13th December**

Thanks to everyone who has already sent in donations for the Christmas Fayre.

_Home baking_ (REMEMBER â€“ NO NUTS)&nbsp;_can be brought to the glass doors side entrance before 9am on the morning of the Fayre_. All baking donations will be collected by P6 and P7 pupils and Miss Kelly.

We look forward to seeing you from 1.30pm in the afternoon of the fayre when we get the chance to see the wonderful stalls the children are running. You may collect your child from class to visit the Fayre with you, but please remember to sign them out by letting their teacher know if you intend to take them home before the end of normal school hours. P1 parents (and those who have joined us recently): please remember to give your child a purse and plenty of change for the morning session on Friday when they will visit the stalls with their class. If they need to wait until your visit in the afternoon, you may not be too popular!
