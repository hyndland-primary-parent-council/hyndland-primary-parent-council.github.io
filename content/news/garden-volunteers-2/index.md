# Garden Volunteers

[April 25, 2013](/news/garden-volunteers-2/) [admin](author/admin/)

Weâ€™re delighted to have P2 mum Helen working alongside Amanda in the garden. If you fancy lending a hand too, contact Amanda to find out what you can do. We are approaching the sowing/planting season and it would be good to have some parent help in place.

Please contact Amanda [njstorey@globalnet.co.uk](mailto:njstorey@globalnet.co.uk) if you can offer any help, no matter how small.
