# Halloween Arrangements

[October 30, 2013](/news/halloween-arrangements/) [admin](author/admin/)

A flyer was in bags yesterday with info about Friday and the Baton next week.

School has decided to dovetail Halloween arrangements with Aftie – so children didn’t need to dress up twice, so the fun would be on Friday 1st November. With imminent industrial action from PSAs this is still the best course of action so children aren’t missing out on any fun. This also allows for children/parents not to stress about costumes being spoiled by wearing to school, before going out to parties or guising on Thursday.

Children can come to school dressed up all day on Friday or if they prefer bring costumes in and change after lunchtime – allowing pupils who choose restrictive disguises to enjoy breaks outside if weather permits without worry of wear and tear. Children who don’t want to dress up can come in Non Uniform.
