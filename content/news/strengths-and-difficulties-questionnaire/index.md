# Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire

[March 11, 2013](news/strengths-and-difficulties-questionnaire/) [admin](author/admin/)

The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a tool used to assess social, emotional and behavioural difficulties of children.

In 2010 it was introduced to Glasgow preschool establishments as part of the transition documentation for children about to start school. In 2012 the SDQ was piloted in P3 and P6 in eight Glasgow schools.

This year the programme will be rolled out to all Glasgow schools at P3 and P6 stages. A letter will be sent out to parents of both stages in the next couple of weeks and questionnaires completed in school shortly after.

More information is available about SDQ at [www.sdqinfo.com](http://www.sdqinfo.com "SDQ Info").
