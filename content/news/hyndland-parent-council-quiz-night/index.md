# Hyndland Parent Council Quiz Night

[September 6, 2017](/news/hyndland-parent-council-quiz-night/) [admin](author/admin/)

**Friday 29 September** sees the return of the Parent Council Quiz Night, hosting by our very own Mums on the Run at&nbsp; **Partick Bowling Club** (right next door to the school).

Starting at **7.30pm** (adults only, no kids allowed!), tickets ( **£5** ) are available from Louise Love in the playground. Entry is also available by payment on the door on the night.

Also, please either bring along raffle prizes on the night, or, if you can’t make it but would like to contribute, please leave raffle prizes / donations in the school office and then email [hyndlandmotr@gmail.com](mailto:hyndlandmotr@gmail.com) or [john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk](mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk) so that we know they are there!

Raffle prizes could include such items as bottles, gift vouchers, chocolates, and anything else that you can think of.

Please also bring along nibbles for the buffet, as pub quizzes can be hungry – as well as thirsty – work!

Thanks, and please come along, meet other parents and carers and demonstrate your powers of trivia while having a drink and a laugh.
