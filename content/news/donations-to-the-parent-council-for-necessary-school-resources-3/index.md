# Donations to the Parent Council for necessary school resources

[May 30, 2017](/news/donations-to-the-parent-council-for-necessary-school-resources-3/) [admin](author/admin/)

Over the past few years, several parents have approached the Parent Council and asked about the possibility of making regular or irregular donations to us (outside of events such as the Ceilidh, Quiz Night, etc.), to continue supporting the school with necessary or desirable resources in which to improve the learning experience of all of the children at the school.

Since the Parent Council purchased the Outdoor Classroom, the funds have been seriously depleted, and ongoing regular activities such as the Ceilidh and Quiz Night are unlikely on their own to raise enough money to fund the various resources that the Parent Council funds, such as the aforementioned Outdoor Classroom, indoor and outdoor sports equipment, buddy caps, high vis vests for school trips, school trips to use the facilities at the Emirates Arena and Scotstoun Leisure Centre and Stadium (thanks to MOTR), blue folders, books, gifts for P7 leavers, Smart Boards, computers, etc. As Glasgow City Council resources are being pegged back through cuts in public sector funding resulting from ongoing austerity measures, it’s imperative that we continue to raise as much money as we can on a continuous basis in order to ensure that our children’s educational experience remains excellent.

We now have a PayPal account which feeds into the Parent Council bank account, where you as parents, carers and your wider families can make such donations if you/they wish. The PayPal account is HPSParentCouncil@outlook.com. Click on the button link to the right to go directly to a donations page for Hyndland Primary School Parent Council.

Thank you!
