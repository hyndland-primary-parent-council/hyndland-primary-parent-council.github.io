# Your Parent Council Needs You!

[June 22, 2015](news/your-parent-council-needs-you/) [admin](author/admin/)

Hyndland Primary School Parent Council is only as good as the support and involvement of those who contribute to it and the work of the wider Parent Forum. We are always looking for as wide a level of engagement with the Parent Council as possible, so please do approach Parent Council representatives with your comments, views and ideas and come along to the monthly meetings.

The next meeting of the Parent Council is the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Wednesday 9 September at 7pm in the school canteen. At the AGM we will be looking for some new Parent Council representatives, including for P1.

Please come along and support us!
