# Non-uniform for International Day

[April 25, 2013](news/non-uniform-for-international-day/) [admin](author/admin/)

**Friday 26th April**

To link with our International Day on Friday, pupils are asked to come to school wearing colours or clothes linked with a country either of their nationality or that they have links with. Pupils are encouraged to bring Â£1 for non-uniform day. The money this month will go towards Outdoor Learning.

Our first International Day will be a chance for pupils to find out more about some of the countries represented in our school. Many thanks to our international parents and families for the planning and preparation they have put into this day, sharing aspects of their language and culture which help enrich our Hyndland Primary community.
