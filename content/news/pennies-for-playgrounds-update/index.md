A massive £447.00 was raised by the children at Hyndland Primary collecting pennies! WELL DONE!

Now to put it to action please come along to the&nbsp;WORKING BEE! 11th August 10am at Hyndland Primary.

We have selected some projects that we are going to do and this is the list of things that we need. We need all hands on deck, please come along; there will be projects for the kids to get involved in too. Please also bring any tools you have that can be used on the day.

The materials we need are:

- 15 – 20 pallets
- Fixings: nails, screws, hinges, pulleys, etc.
- Paint: colourful playground floor paint, colourful outdoor metal work paint, sandpaper
- 1 x 3m broom handle / thick dowel / circular wood (the mast of a sail), triangular canvas material and eyelets (sail)
- 8 wooden blocks for seats on the boat approx. 300mm x 300mm x 200mm (to be painted), steering wheel (for boat)
- Stencils: for markings on the playground
- Paintbrushes / rollers, paint trays
