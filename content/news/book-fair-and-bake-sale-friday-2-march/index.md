# Book Fair and Bake Sale, Friday 2 March

[February 28, 2018](news/book-fair-and-bake-sale-friday-2-march/) [admin](author/admin/)

The Parent Council is hosting a coffee afternoon in the school dining hall on Friday 2 March, 2-3pm. As part of the fundraising efforts for their leaving party, the P7 children are running a book and bake sale at that event.

The children are looking for book and baking donations to sell on the stall. If you have one or two books (in good condition, kids or grown-up titles) that you or your children would be happy to part with then please bring them into school by Thursday 1 March.

Also, if you would like to donate something for the cake stall, then please send it in with your child on March 2. (Please remember&nbsp;not to bring anything with nuts in!)

Hope to see you on the day!
