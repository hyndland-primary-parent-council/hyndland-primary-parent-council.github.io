# School Garden Market Sale

[September 6, 2017](news/school-garden-market-sale/) [admin](author/admin/)

We will be holding the school garden market sale this&nbsp; **Friday 8 September in the school playground at pick up time** to raise some funds for the school.

We’ll be selling produce from the garden and any baking donations (no nuts please!).

We are harvesting just now (mainly potatoes, apples and kale).

Any donations of baked goods or produce from allotments (for those who have one) would be much appreciated at the time of the sale.

Thank you!
