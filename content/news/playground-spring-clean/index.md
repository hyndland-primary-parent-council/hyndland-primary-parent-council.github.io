# Playground Spring Clean

[May 16, 2013](/news/playground-spring-clean/) [admin](author/admin/)

Sunday 19th May, 10am to 4pm

It’s nearly upon us! Sunday is our annual Spring Clean day when we do many of the jobs which spruce up the playground and further enhance our children’s play space as well as creating opportunities for outdoor learning.

**If you can lend a hand sometime between 10am and 4pm (for an hour or two or even the whole day if you’re feeling up for it!) we’d love to see you.** Many hands make light work (allegedly!). Refreshments will be available in the Afty. Kids are welcome, but remain the responsibility of the adult accompanying them.

Here’s a photo of some of last year’s team to inspire you!

Bringing your own equipment if you have it would mean that many things can be done at once. We’re particularly looking for saws, electric or traditional, pruning equipment, brooms, spaces, trowels, hand tools etc. If you have any gardening gloves, that would also be great. Being able to spot your own at the end is easier if they’re labelled (either that or they never leave your sight!). Grandparents and family friends also welcome to join in.

Fiona Kerr sent letters home last week with details of what needs to be done. If you missed it (or it got lost in the bottom of a schoolbag), you can download a copy here:&nbsp;[PLayground Spring Clean flier 2013](/assets/images/2013/05/PLayground-Spring-Clean-flier-2013.doc)

**If you’re planning on coming but haven’t yet let us know, please do, so we have an idea of numbers. If it’s too much hassle to fill in the form and send it back, you can [email Jane](mailto:janegrove@btinternet.com) to say you’re coming (and preferably what equipment you can bring).**
