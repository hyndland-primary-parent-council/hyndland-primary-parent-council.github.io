Come along to the Ceilidh and celebrate it nearly being Burns’ Night.

We are looking for volunteers to help out getting raffle and tombola prizes prior to the night and/or to help out on the night, taking door money, selling raffle tickets, setting up and clearing up at the end.

We need food donations for the children’s (and adults’) food buffet. No nuts in the food please!

There is no cash bar, so please bring your own bottle. There is a Sainsbury’s express supermarket next door and several off licences in the close vicinity.

Soft drinks for the children, non-drinkers and designated drivers will be available for free on the night for as long as the stocks last.

Please see the poster above and flyers that will be posted around the school for further info.

Come along and support your Parent Council while having a fun night out with the kids!
