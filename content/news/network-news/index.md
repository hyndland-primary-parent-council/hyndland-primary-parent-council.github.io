Glasgow City Council have set up an ASL Parent Forum who meet regularly in order to:

- Get regular and reliable information about what Education Services were doing about additional support for learning
- Link up and communicate with other parents whose children have additional support needs
- Ask questions and receive answers about additional support in Glasgow
- Get news about national and local developments relating to additional support

If you would like to join the forum or receive newsletter please email or phone Yvette Duffy [yvette.duffy@education.glasgow.gov.uk](mailto:yvette.duffy@education.glasgow.gov.uk) 0141 287 0204
