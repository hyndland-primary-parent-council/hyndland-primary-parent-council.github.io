# Parent Council Quiz Night & P7 Bake/Book Sale Postponed

[March 2, 2018](/news/parent-council-quiz-night-p7-bake-book-sale-postponed/) [admin](author/admin/)

Unfortunately, due to the weather, the school being closed, and an inability to get hold of the bowling club, we’ve decided to postpone the Quiz Night tonight.

We believe that it would be much less likely that people would turn up as a result of a combination of the above factors, and given that it’s a fundraiser, that would be a disaster!

Due to the availability of the organisers, the Easter holidays, the early May bank holiday and the school P7 trip to Dunoon, the next likely date for the Quiz Night is Friday 11 May, but this still needs to be confirmed. We will let you know ASAP, and will hold on to any raffle prize donations until then.

A revised date for the P7 Book/Bake Sale will be sent out as soon as an alternative time is arranged.

Apologies for the short notice, but enjoy the “extended weekend”, be safe on your feet on the slippery ground, and, most importantly, don’t eat yellow snow!
