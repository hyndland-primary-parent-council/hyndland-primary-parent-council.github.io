# Social & Fundraising Activity

[August 20, 2015](/news/social-fundraising-activity/) [admin](author/admin/)

There are a dwindling number of parents who do all the planning of most Parent Council fundraising events and much of the work that goes into organising and running the ceilidhs, quizzes and band nights that raise the money which benefits the education of all of our children. We really do need more volunteers!

If you think you could offer any help or ideas with social or other activities which will help raise funds for the school, please come along to the AGM or any Parent Council meeting, or contact [Linda McCormick](mailto:lindamccormick1@googlemail.com) or [John Lewis](mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk).

Events to look forward to this term include a Quiz Night and a Ceilidh and we will be keen to hear about any other social fundraising activities that you might have.

All funds raised get ploughed into school resources to enrich the learning and recreational experience for our children.
