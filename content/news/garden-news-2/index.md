You may have noticed a few changes around the school grounds, thanks in large part to a huge effort from Susan Taylor (Parent Council Additional Member), who has been in working away after school and at weekends to improve the outdoor environment around the school.

Helen and Susan have also been discussing some of the plans for the school garden and playgrounds. One of these is to get the garden ‘ready for winter’. This involves getting the raised beds fixed and planting some winter crops (kale and brassicas). We are also looking to do a general tidy and clean up around the grounds before the bad weather hits.

If you would like to help out, we have the following jobs that need to be done:

- wash the bike shelter
- general weeding and tidying around the garden and playgrounds
- painting / decorating wheelie bin planters
- painting the toadstoools
- fixing noticeboards in the garden
- painting and decorating the garden gate

If anyone is free at anytime and would like to help out, please contact Helen at [hjrolph@gmail.com](mailto:hjrolph@gmail.com).
