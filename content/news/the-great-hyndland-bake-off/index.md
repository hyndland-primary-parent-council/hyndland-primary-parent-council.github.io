# The ‘Great Hyndland Bake Off’

[May 30, 2017](news/the-great-hyndland-bake-off/) [admin](author/admin/)

On Friday 12 May, Hyndland Primary School held its very own edition of the critically acclaimed (or at least widely watched) “Bake Off”, in the interim period during its transition from the BBC to C4. Unfortunately, neither Mary Berry nor Paul Hollywood were in attendance, nor the intrepid Mel and Sue, but we did have out very own Louise Love and Mums on the Run, who by all accounts arranged a veritable bakers’ banquet, with numerous entries coming in from across the pupil and parent body.

The afternoon provided an opportunity for the confectionery entries to be feasted upon by pupils, parents and staff and the cake and bakery sales and donations made a hefty £280.45, which would surely give Greggs (or for older ‘Blackadder’ fans like myself, Mrs Miggins’ Pie Shop) a run for their money!

Thank you and well done to all of the bakers for your entries and to Louise, MOTR and all of the parent and pupil helpers for arranging and facilitating a successful and enjoyable day.

If anyone has more fundraising ideas to help the Parent Council raise funds to make improvements to the learning experience for the children at the school (and for outdoor learning in particular), please contact Nadia Miller or Daria Jarrett via the Parent Council email: enquiries@hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org

_The Head Teacher, Ms Helen Brown, says: “Thanks again for all the hard work and creativity poured into [this] event – it was nice to see so many people coming along to support a good cause but also enjoying being together – a classic case of having their cake and eating it!”_
