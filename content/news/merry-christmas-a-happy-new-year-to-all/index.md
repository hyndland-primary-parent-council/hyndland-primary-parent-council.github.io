# Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year to all!

[December 20, 2017](/news/merry-christmas-a-happy-new-year-to-all/) [admin](author/admin/)

It’s almost that time of year again, when our homes are bright and sparkly and invariably smell of fresh pine; stockings are hung out to be filled and children all over are eating way too many chocolates while awaiting the impending arrival of the red-suited fella himself.

School finishes today for the end of term, Christmas and the year. Another productive term at Hyndland Primary School, the children are undoubtedly tired and in need of a rest before the holiday excitement really kicks off, as I’m sure are all the staff!

The last few weeks have been a hive of activity, from the P1-3 Christmas play to the Christmas Fayre, from the Festive Service to Janny John and several other staff taking part in the Santa Dash in George Square for the Beatson Cancer Centre, raising over £200 – well done all!

I think we can also say well done to all the children and staff at the school and also to the parents contributing to the activities and fundraising in various ways. Thank you!

On behalf of the Parent Council may we wish you all a Merry Christmas and a peaceful holiday and a Happy New Year, and we look forward to seeing you all in 2018!

Best wishes,

John Lewis  
Chair, Hyndland Primary School Parent Council
