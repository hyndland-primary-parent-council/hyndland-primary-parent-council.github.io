# Building works at the school

[August 20, 2015](/news/building-works-at-the-school/) [admin](author/admin/)

It could hardly have escaped anyone’s attention that the school is practically surrounded by scaffolding. This went up over the summer holidays and is in place to enable the planned work to make sure that the school is windproof and water-tight. This is part of GCC’s ‘4R’s’ Estates Strategy (Right Schools, Right Size, Right Place, Right Time).

The work will last approximately 12 months and will consist of repairs to the roof, skylights, atrium, stonework, guttering and downpipes, new windows throughout (though modelled on the existing windows due to Historic Scotland requirements), and a full internal refurbishment throughout the school.

The work will be undertaken without the need to decamp from the school, as classes will be moved into different rooms as they are refurbished.
