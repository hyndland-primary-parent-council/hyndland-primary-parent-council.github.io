# Happy New Year to all!

[January 10, 2018](news/happy-new-year-to-all/) [admin](author/admin/)

In the immortal words of the theme song to&nbsp;_Trumpton_, “Time flies by when you’re the driver of a train”. Well I dunno about that, as I’ve never actually driven a train, but those Christmas holidays sure did fly by pretty darn fast!

We’re now clocking up close to one-fifth of the way through this century and two per cent of the way through this millennium (impressive numeracy skills, eh?), so we need to get cracking!

We have been in discussions with the school regarding fundraising plans for improving the outdoor learning space, so you will hear more about that during the rest of the school year and beyond. Hopefully not to infinity though, or that blaes crater in the Toppy will never get sorted by the Council!

I hope that you and your families all had an enjoyable and peaceful holiday, and on behalf of the Parent Council, may I wish you all a Happy New Year, and we look forward to seeing you all this year!

Best wishes,

John Lewis  
Chair, Hyndland Primary School Parent Council
