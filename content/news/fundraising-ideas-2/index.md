# Fundraising ideas

[October 21, 2013](news/fundraising-ideas-2/) [admin](author/admin/)

Remember: We’re taking a fresh look at the way we raise funds to help the school and are looking for more volunteers to join us. Why not have a go? Louise’s plan for Mums on the Run is just one example of how you could come up with an idea and we can help you to get it started. If you have a great idea you’d like to share with us, if you and a bunch of friends are up for a project, or even if you’d be happy to be given a wee task from time to time, let us know. It’s your school. Come and be part of it. Contact Jane: [janegrove@btinternet.com](mailto:janegrove@btinternet.com)

Fundraising meetings will now be on the first Thursday of each month from 9pm at Cottiers. Everyone welcome.
