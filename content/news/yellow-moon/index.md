# Yellow Moon

[October 21, 2013](news/yellow-moon/) [admin](author/admin/)

Catalogues for Yellow Moon were sent home in schoolbags before the holiday.

A great way to stock up on craft supplies, Christmas presents, and party gifts whilst raising money to support the school. Order online using the Hyndland Primary Parent Council code SHY1021. No need to scrabble around for envelopes and exact money. Each order donates up to 20% cash-back to Parent Council fundraising. It couldnâ€™t be easier!

If anyone fancies taking on the infrequent task of receiving the catalogues once they arrive in school, sticking our code label on the front and dividing up into classes to be distributed by teachers (take about an hour an a half) contact Jane [janegrove@btinternet.com](mailto:janegrove@btinternet.com)
