# Parent Council Annual General Meeting Re-Schedule

[September 20, 2017](/news/parent-council-annual-general-meeting-re-schedule/) [admin](author/admin/)

Unfortunately, it was not possible to reschedule the cancelled Parent Council meeting last week, and as it’s the AGM and we usually get quite a few more parents along, it wasn’t possible to move to another venue at such short notice.

Due to other commitments, it will not be possible to rearrange the meeting before the next scheduled Parent Council meeting. As such, the AGM will not take place on&nbsp; **Wednesday 11 October** , at 7pm in the School Dining Hall.
