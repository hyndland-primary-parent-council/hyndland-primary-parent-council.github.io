# Welcome from the Chair of HPSPC

[September 2, 2016](/news/welcome-from-the-chair-of-hpspc/) [admin](author/admin/)

Welcome back to the start of a new school year, and for those of you who are new to the school, welcome to Hyndland Primary School.

After yet another Glasgow summer of indifferent weather, another year of great learning and development for our children is underway. The school building in experiencing a physical – and very welcome – transformation both inside and out. There are several more months of work still to go, but the builders are turning the school into a lighter, brighter and – as appropriate to the outside weather conditions – dryer, less drafty/more airy environment, which is better for learning for the children and, indeed, better for working for all of the staff.

Also, I’d like to take this opportunity to formally thank Kate O’Brien (who has moved on from the school) and Sarah Frood for arranging and leading on the design, fundraising and hands-on making of the playground furniture you see in the P2 playground, as part of their ‘Pennies for the Playground’ project. Thanks to everyone who helped out.

Alas, we have also said goodbye to Janny Joe, a 21 year dedicated stalwart of janitorial services at the school and who will be sadly missed by staff, parents and the children.

Finally, for parent who have been with the school for some time, as well as those of you who are new, the work of the Parent Council, along with that of all of the parents who contribute to its activities, is a collective effort and we all have a vested interest in the fortunes of the school and in the positive experience of our children and the staff during our time at and with the school. So, we on the Parent Council look forward to working with the school and, most importantly, all of you as parents to ensure that Hyndland Primary School continues to provide a happy, healthy, enjoyable and appropriately challenging educational experience for all of our young people.

Involvement with the Parent Council, either as a Rep or attending meetings and other activities as a parent really is a great chance to find out what’s going on in the school. So, please do become involved and, should you wish to discuss any issues please either get in touch with the Parent Rep for your child or children’s school year (or, indeed, any of the Parent Reps), or contact me at [john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk](mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk).

On behalf of the Parent Council I wish all of the children and staff at our school a successful and fun year, and hope that we will all enjoy the experience along with our children.

Best wishes,  
John
