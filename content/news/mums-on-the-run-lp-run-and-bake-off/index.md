# Mums on the Run LP Run and Bake Off

[December 21, 2015](news/mums-on-the-run-lp-run-and-bake-off/) [admin](author/admin/)

On Friday 11 December our indefatigable MOTR undertook an LP run, which, in the style of an LP (for those of us old enough to know what they are!) ran around the cricket pitch for 33 1/3 minutes and then went into a bake-off.

MOTR raised £86.00 from the run and Bake Off and this will go towards funding new Buddy Caps for the school Buddies.

Those taking part in the LP Run and Bake Off were Louise Love, Helen Newstead, Helen Gibson, Lisa Logan, Vari Macdonald, Ali Walker, Leigh Garden, Marion Grant, Eileen Faulds, Lesley Connelly, Barbara McGinley, Clare McGinley, Linda McCormick and Daria Jarrett.

The winner of the Bake Off was Lesley Connelly – well done Lesley!

_ **MOTR would like to say a special thank you to the Butterscotch Bakery for donating the prize.** _
