# City-wide Consultation on Glasgow Secondary Schools (Placing Requests and Catchment Areas)

[July 8, 2018](news/city-wide-consultation-on-glasgow-secondary-schools-placing-requests-and-catchment-areas/) [admin](author/admin/)

On Monday 14 May Glasgow City Council (GCC) issued a lengthy school consultation on secondary school Placing Requests and School Catchment Areas, which runs from 14 May until 24 September.

The proposals that were approved by GCC’s City Administration Committee are available at: [https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=22550](https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=22550). They provide a glimpse on how GCC will propose changes to Secondary Schools’ placing requests criteria, as well as allocating catchment areas to 17 secondary schools in Glasgow.

As it is a large scale consultation that will affect many families across Glasgow, it would be advisable for those of you who have children who will progress to secondary school over the next several years to read through the consultation thoroughly and respond.

Hyndland Primary School Parent Council will contact parents and carers who have children at the school after the summer holidays (so that the new P1 parents and carers are included), in order to provide a collective response.

This may be particularly of interest for parents and carers whose children entered Hyndland Primary School as placing requests.

Additionally, GCC has now committed to start preparatory work for the consultation to review the admission policy of Notre Dame High School (currently girls only), just after the above is concluded in the Autumn.
