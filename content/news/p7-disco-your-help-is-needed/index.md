# P7 Disco – Your help is needed

[May 30, 2017](/news/p7-disco-your-help-is-needed/) [admin](author/admin/)

**LEAVERS DISCO, Thurs 22 June, 7-8.30pm**

Over the last four years parents have run the P7 Leavers Disco. It used to be run by the school, however in 2013 the P7s decided they wanted something a little more special. There is a disco with games, bought in pizza, drinks and snacks and the gym hall is decorated specially for the evening. Last year the P7 parents also introduced leavers’ t-shirts which were very popular with the kids. The P7s also get a leavers’ present. This year it will be a scientific calculator, which all pupils use at secondary.

The Parent Council put money towards the leavers’ presents and the party, but we need to ask P7 parents to make a donation towards the overall costs. The cost will be approx. £7 but will be confirmed once we find a DJ and cost the t-shirts.

**HELP NEEDED – For the Leavers Disco to be a success we need your help!**

Are there any P7 parents who are DJs or do you know a good DJ that is free on the 22nd? If so, get in touch.

We will need between 4-6 parent volunteers to help on the afternoon of the 22nd to set up the gym and also 4-6 volunteers to help out during the disco.

Before the disco it would be good to also have a group of parents to help organise it, including ordering the pizzas, buying snacks and decorations and sorting out the goody bags.

If you have any other ideas that could make the Disco memorable, we’d be happy to hear about them too. One year they had a photo booth!

If you can help at all, please contact Lorne Bourhill (P7 Parent Council Rep), saying what you would like to be involved in.

**P7 YEARBOOK**

The school will also produce a very simple yearbook with photos of the pupils from P1 and P7. Please could you send in a photo of your child when they started school, even if your child was at a different school in P1. The photos will be scanned and returned to you.

Please let the school know if you don’t want your child’s photo to be included in the yearbook.
