# Active French

[June 16, 2016](news/active-french/) [admin](author/admin/)

Active French is growing! With just a few spaces left in after-school classes on Mondays,&nbsp;Tuesdays, and Wednesdays for children in P2-P7, I am now able to offer places for an&nbsp;additional Thursday class which is particularly suitable for children in P1. Classes take place&nbsp;at Hyndland Primary but are also open to children from other schools and arrangements can&nbsp;be made for children who attend Afty to come along and join us.

Active French aims to introduce children to French in an exciting, stimulating way suited to&nbsp;their stage of development. Games, songs, action and movement enable the children to take&nbsp;an active part in their learning with the emphasis on fun.

Classes begin in August and the block runs until the October break. If youâ€™re interested in a&nbsp;place for your child or would like further details please email Jane Grove:&nbsp;[janegrove@btinternet.com](mailto:janegrove@btinternet.com) or phone 07732019428
