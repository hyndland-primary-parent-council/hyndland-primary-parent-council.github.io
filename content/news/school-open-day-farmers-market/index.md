# School Open Day / Farmers Market

[October 6, 2014](news/school-open-day-farmers-market/) [admin](author/admin/)

Thank you to all parents, carers, grandparents and friends who were able to donate produce from their gardens and allotments, as well as bake cakes, etc., on 17 September. John Lewis says that he did manage to donate some semi-burned cakes that heâ€™d never previously made and sans recipe, and apologises retrospectively to anyone who purchased the mini bramble and apple crumble tarts, but hopes that his Welsh cakes were much more palatable!

We would also like to thank P4 parents Lisa Logan and Madeleine Hynes for helping the school set up and manages the stalls on the day.&nbsp; **Thanks ladies!**
