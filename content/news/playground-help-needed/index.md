# Playground – Help needed!

[October 5, 2012](news/playground-help-needed/) [admin](author/admin/)

**Sunday 7th October, from 10am**

**As part of our ongoing commitment to improving the playground we are looking for some strong chaps to lay astroturf in the top playground.**

On Saturday the eroded ground by the trees along the fence is going to be in-filled and levelled by contractors. On Sunday, weather permitting, we need to lay the council-donated astroturf. The rolls of astroturf weigh one and a half tons… so we need at least 10 volunteers to complete the job. The current astroturf in the middle playground has proved extremely popular with the children. Let’s make a difference to the top playground too.

**Can you help? Email [Jane](mailto:janegrove@btinternet.com) if you can make it.**
