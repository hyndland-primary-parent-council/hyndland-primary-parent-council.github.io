# Quiz Night, 5th October

[September 28, 2012](/news/quiz-night-5th-october/) [admin](author/admin/)

Friday 5th October, Hyndland Bowling Club, Queensborough Gardens, 7.30pm  
Tickets £5  
Adults only – get your sitter sorted!

The first social event of the new school year is our ever-popular Quiz Night.&nbsp;Regulars will know that it’s an opportunity to get together, have a drink, supper&nbsp;and a chat and maybe&nbsp;try your hand at a few questions if you feel like it.&nbsp; You can take it as seriously as you want…which tends to mean two or three teams vying for the trophy and the rest just along for a pleasant night out.&nbsp;This time we’re giving our regular Quiz masters Pat and Grant a rest, so it’s over to Phil Taylor to see what he can throw at us.

If you’ve never been before, have a chat with a few pals and make your own team or come along on the night and we’ll find a group for you to join. Non-Hyndland parents & friends are also very welcome!&nbsp; P1 parents can speak to Linda (Katie’s mum) in the P1 playground to find out all about it.

Buffet Supper is included and we welcome any contributions, savoury or sweet, you&nbsp;would like to bring along.&nbsp; We’re also looking for Raffle Prizes.&nbsp; All money raised goes to help the school.&nbsp; Our current focus is playground improvements.

**Tickets can be purchased from Jane in the main playground** &nbsp;or by putting the correct money in an envelope marked Quiz Night along with your child’s name and class and posting it in the Parent Council box next to the school office.&nbsp; Cash or cheques payable to Hyndland Primary School Parent Council.
