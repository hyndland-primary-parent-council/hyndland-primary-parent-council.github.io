# Parent Council Dates for this Term

[October 6, 2014](news/parent-council-dates-for-this-term/) [admin](author/admin/)

Please come along to the Parent Council meetings, hear about what’s happening in your school and share your own views on what you think would improve the experience for our children. The Parent Council are either in the school dinner hall or the staff room and the dates this term are:

– Wednesday 8 October, 7.00-8.30pm

– Wednesday 12 November, 7.00-8.30pm

Go to the main door and press the buzzer for the Janny for entry.

Dates for next term will be published closer to the time.
