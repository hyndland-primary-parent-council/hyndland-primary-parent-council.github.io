# Parent Council Meetings

[January 10, 2013](news/parent-council-meetings/) [admin](author/admin/)

Parents and carers are always welcome to come along to Parent Council meetings. Along with parents representing your child’s class, meetings are attended by senior management of the school, a teacher rep, Afty management and any parent/carer who wants to find out what’s happening!

If you wish to raise an issue, contact your year rep (see [Contact Us](http://www.hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org/contact-us/ "Contact Us") page) or Jane Grove (chair) or Alison Mussett (secretary) to have your item added to the agenda, or come along on the night. The next few meetings scheduled for this year are:

- Wednesday 16th January
- Wednesday 20th February
- Wednesday 20th March

Meetings are held in the school Dining room from 7.30-9pm.
