# It’s Halloween and you feel like dancing…? (new date)

[October 14, 2018](news/its-halloween-and-you-feel-like-dancing-new-date/) [admin](author/admin/)

NB: The date of this event has been changed from 2 November to 26 October due to availability of Parent Council volunteers. There is no bar at the Hyndland Community Halls, so it is Bring Your Own Bottle (BYOB). There is a Sainsbury’s Local next door to the venue. Soft drinks will be provided for children and alcohol-free adults.
