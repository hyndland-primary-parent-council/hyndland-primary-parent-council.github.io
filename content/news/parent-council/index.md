# Parent Council

[August 22, 2014](/news/parent-council/) [admin](author/admin/)

If you are interested in hearing about the activities of the Parent Council, come along to the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Wednesday 10 September 7.00-8.30pm in the School dining room. At the AGM you can hear reports about what happened last year, including ongoing playground improvements, garden, social events and music club, as well as hear from the Head Teacher, Ms Brown. If you are interested in getting involved, there are elections for new council members at the AGM. Everyone is welcome.

You are also welcome to attend any of the other Parent Council’s monthly meetings. The Parent Council is an important voice in the school community. It provides a forum for discussing developments in the school and ensuring that the perspective of the parents whose children attend the school is considered.

Much of the work undertaken in and by the Parent Council has funded a variety of things, including school folders, school buddy hats, PE/sports equipment, Outdoor Learning, SMART Boards, books and other resources.

Additionally, each school year has a Parent Representative who you can contact if you have any ideas, questions, issues or concerns, and after the different years’ representatives are confirmed at the Annual General Meeting at the school on 10 September, we will confirm the contact names in the Newsletter soon afterwards.

In the meantime, the Parent Representative is likely to be the same person who was the representative for your child’s year last year – i.e. if they were the P2 rep last year, they will be the P3 rep this year, and so on. We will be looking for new Parent Reps for P1 and P4.

If you are unsure who your Parent Representative is and wish to discuss anything, please contact the new Chair, John Lewis, at [john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk](mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk).

Meetings of the Parent Council this term are on the following dates:

Wednesday 10 September, 7.00-8.30pm (AGM)  
Wednesday 8 October, 7.00-8.30pm  
Wednesday 12 November, 7.00-8.30pm

Go to the main door and press the buzzer for the Janny for entry.

Dates for next term will be published closer to the time.
