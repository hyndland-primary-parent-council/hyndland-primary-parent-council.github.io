# Uniform Orders

[June 12, 2014](/news/uniform-orders/) [admin](author/admin/)

Border Embroideries (our uniform supplier) are working 24/7 to complete new uniform orders placed before 9 June, which will be ready for collection by the end of term. If you haven’t yet ordered any uniform you require, you can still do so via our [School Uniform](http://www.hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org/school-uniform/) page.

All online orders placed between 9 June and 23 July will be delivered free to school on Monday 11 August, and you can call in to collect on either the Monday or Tuesday before term starts on Wednesday 13 August. Home delivery (£4.99) is also available. Please be aware that it will take the full 14 days to be dispatched as this is the busiest time of the year.

If you would like to purchase a school tie (optional), these can be found at Man’s World on Byres Road.
