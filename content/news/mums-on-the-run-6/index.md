# Mums on the Run

[March 2, 2014](news/mums-on-the-run-6/) [admin](author/admin/)

HUGE thanks to our Mums On The Run; Mrs Anderson met with our Pupil Council to identify some portable outdoor resources to make playtimes more fun and all our classes now have access to waterproof clothing so that Rain does not equal the pain of staying inside at breaks and lunches!

A group of thirteen Hyndland mums has signed up to do the Glasgow Women’s 10k on Mothers’ Day this May. With a combined age of 497, a pack weight of 825kg, four inhalers, and a whole lot of extra-firm Lycra we run every Thursday morning after drop-off. Some of the mums can’t always make it, so they let others know when they can run to see if there’s anyone else who could join them. Come along if you fancy 2014 as the year of your first 10k or you’re interested in having a run with a mixed-ability group or you just fancy meeting some new people and getting a bit fitter. Guaranteed, if you ever fancied running and have never quite known how to start, going out with a group is the most enjoyable way to do it. (We often finish with coffee and cake)

If the group isn’t your thing, you can follow us on Twitter and just leave supportive messages to make us feel better about going out in the rain – [@HyndlandMOTR](http://twitter.com/HyndlandMOTR "HyndlandMOTR - Twitter")
