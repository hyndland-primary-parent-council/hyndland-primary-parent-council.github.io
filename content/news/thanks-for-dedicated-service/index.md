# Thanks for dedicated service

[May 31, 2013](news/thanks-for-dedicated-service/) [admin](author/admin/)

At the end of term we will sadly be losing not only our Head Teacher, Ms Laville, as she retires&nbsp;but also three long-standing members of staff who have&nbsp;dedicated many years service to the children of Hyndland Primary.&nbsp; Mrs Linda Francis and Miss Fiona Miller (both with over 20 years service to the infant department) will retire and Mrs Fiona Kerr (who has been at Hyndland for 18 years) has been promoted to Head Teacher at Sandwood Primary School.

Several parents have mentioned that they would like to&nbsp;contribute to gifts from&nbsp;Hyndland’s families to show our appreciation for their commitment to our school and have asked the Parent Council to organise a collection.

If you would like to make a contribution, Jane will be collecting in the playground in the coming weeks, or you can post an envelope marked “Staff leavers” with your child’s name and class in the Parent Council box next to the office.&nbsp; Cards will be available nearer the end of term for your messages and memories.
