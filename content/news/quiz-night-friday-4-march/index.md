# Quiz Night – Friday 4 March

[February 23, 2016](/news/quiz-night-friday-4-march/) [admin](author/admin/)

Hyndland Mums on the Run presents the Hyndland Primary School Parent Council Quiz Night

Friday 4 March, 7.30pm

Partick Bowling Club, Fortrose Street

Tickets £5 – available in the playground or on the door on the night

Book a babysitter (no kids allowed!), bring along something sweet or savoury for the buffet (finger food only as we don’t have cutlery!), and come along to help raise funds for buddy caps for the school buddies.

We are also looking for raffle prizes – if you have any suitable prizes, please bring along on the night
