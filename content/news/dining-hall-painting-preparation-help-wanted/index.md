# Dining Hall painting preparation – help wanted

[June 12, 2013](/news/dining-hall-painting-preparation-help-wanted/) [admin](author/admin/)

We’re getting the Dining Hall painted during the summer holidays. If you are able to lend a hand on 16th-17/18th July or could spend some time before the end of term taking down posters etc. to prepare for painting, we’d love to hear from you. Contact [John](mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk) or Mrs Kerr.
