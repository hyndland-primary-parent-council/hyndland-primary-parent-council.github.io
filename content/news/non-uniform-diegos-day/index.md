# Non-Uniform – Diego’s Day

[May 29, 2013](news/non-uniform-diegos-day/) [admin](author/admin/)

Our non-uniform day this month is on Friday 31st May. The theme is ‘wear something yellow’. This is in recognition that Diego was called our ‘sunshine boy’ as he was always smiling.

Diego was a pupil who attended Hyndland until P6. Diego was diagnosed with a brain tumour early in his life and battled this for many years. He sadly passed away in 2005. The mosaics in our playground were created to celebrate and remember Diego’s life. We allocate one of our non-uniform days in May each year as Diego’s Day and contributions collected are donated towards a charity of his mum’s choosing.

Thank you for your support in advance
