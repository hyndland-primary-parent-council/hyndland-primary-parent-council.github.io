# School Website

[March 2, 2014](/news/school-website/) [admin](author/admin/)

Mrs McFadyen has been working very hard putting the finishing touches to our school website, after a technical glitch outwith our control last week, we should be up and running at the end of the week. If any of our parents have any ‘webspertise’ and have some time to pitch in with web work, then please get in touch with Mrs McFadyen – the template that GCC provide could be tailored so that it dazzles as much as the contributors! When we have the framework ready, Mrs McFadyen will be working alongside pupils to keep you up to date with curricular news, events and celebrations – so if you would like to work with our children, we welcome parental support in all forms!
