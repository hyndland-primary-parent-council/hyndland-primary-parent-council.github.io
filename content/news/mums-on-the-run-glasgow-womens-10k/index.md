# Mums on the Run – Glasgow Women’s 10K

[May 7, 2014](news/mums-on-the-run-glasgow-womens-10k/) [admin](author/admin/)

Sunday 11th May

**PLEASE SPONSOR JANE as she raises funds for the school**

&nbsp;

This Sunday the Hyndland Mums on the Run will be taking on their next challenge. Lesley Anne Anderson, Helen Newstead, Ailsa Grant, Marion Grant, Eileen Faulds, Ali Walker, Carolyn Bonnyman, Vari MacDonald, Barbara McGinley, Charan Manak, Jane Marland, Linda McCormick and Louise Love will be giving it their all in their Hyndland green gym tshirts. We wish them all lots of luck (and any other Hyndland mums, aunties etc. who are entering) in beating their personal best times or for some, achieving their first ever 10k.

Jane Grove will be joining them (Ha! who’d have ever though it!) and after this week’s sprint races across Bell’s Bridge… she’s just hoping to make it to the finish! With Harry and the rest of P7 moving on to secondary school imminently, this is Jane’s last year on the Parent Council and she hopes to make this her penultimate fundraising opportunity for the school.&nbsp;_ **So please share the love, click on the link and cheer Jane and the rest of the team on with your pledges.** _ **Thanks!**
