# Support your local Parent Council

[August 20, 2015](news/support-your-local-parent-council/) [admin](author/admin/)

You are also welcome and encouraged to attend any of the other Parent Council’s monthly meetings. The Parent Council is an important voice in the school community. It provides a forum for discussing developments in the school and ensuring that the perspective of the parents whose children attend the school is considered.

Much of the work undertaken in and by the Parent Council has funded a variety of things, including the excellent new outdoor classroom in the top playground, school folders, school buddy hats, PE/sports equipment, playground equipment, gardening activities, SMART boards, books and other educational resources.

Additionally, each school year has a Parent Representative who you can contact if you have any ideas, questions, issues or concerns, and after the different years’ representatives and Chair are confirmed at the Annual General Meeting at the school on 9th September, we will let you know the contact names in the Newsletter soon afterwards, as well as on the website.

In the meantime, there are continuing Parent Representatives who will be available for you to speak with. If you are unsure who your Parent Representative is and wish to discuss anything, please contact the Chair, John Lewis, at [john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk](mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk).

We will be looking for new Parent Reps this year, but would encourage you to become involved, as the Parent Council provides a great opportunity for you to keep abreast of what’s going on at the school.

Meetings of the Parent Council are held in the staff room, apart from the AGM, which is held in the school dining hall. The dates this term are:

- Wednesday 9th September, 7.00-8.30pm (AGM)
- Wednesday 7th October, 7.00-8.30pm
- Wednesday 11th October, 7.00-8.30pm

Go to the main door and press the buzzer for the Janny for entry.

Dates for next term will be published closer to the time.
