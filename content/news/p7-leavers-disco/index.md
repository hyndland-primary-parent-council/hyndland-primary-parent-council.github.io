# P7 Leavers’ Disco

[June 12, 2013](/news/p7-leavers-disco/) [admin](author/admin/)

Wednesday 19th June, 7pm-8.30pm, £3.

Letters will make it home in school bags in the next couple of days. If your P7 is coming along to the Leavers Disco (a really special way to celebrate the end of the Primary School days together) please make sure you sign and return the permission slip regarding whether they will be picked up at the end of the evening or are allowed to walk home. No form = no entry. Payment for tickets will not be accepted without the permission slip.

A wee team of P7 parents has begun dividing up tasks and along with coordinator Catherine Harte (Depute) are looking for more parents to help decorate the hall on the day, set out refreshments and volunteer to help on the night. Contact Catherine Harte in school or Jane Grove, if you can help, or find P7 mums Kellie, Linda or Elsa in the playground.
