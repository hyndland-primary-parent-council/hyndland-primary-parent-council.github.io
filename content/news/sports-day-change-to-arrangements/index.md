# Sports Day – Change to arrangements

[June 12, 2013](news/sports-day-change-to-arrangements/) [admin](author/admin/)

Friday 14th June  
Cricket Pitch, Peel Street

With fingers crossed for sunshine and a dry day on Friday, we hope to see many of you there. If you are able to help with a station or are able to escort classes to and from the cricket ground, please contact Fiona Kerr (Depute).

The P1-3 events will run from 9.45-11.45 and the P4-7 events will run from 1.15-3.15.

If the weather is inclement, there is a possibility of a fall-back date of Wednesday 19th.
