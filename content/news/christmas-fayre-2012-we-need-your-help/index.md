# Christmas Fayre 2012 – we need your help!

[October 12, 2012](/news/christmas-fayre-2012-we-need-your-help/) [admin](author/admin/)

This year’s Xmas Fayre will be on Fri 7 Dec and there are a few things you might be able to help us with.

**1. Call to Craft!**

We’re looking for keen knitters and sew-ers to help us to create Christmas Decorations and other saleable items for our craft stall. If you’d like any knitting patterns emailed to you, contact [Alison Mussett](mailto:alison.mussett@btinternet.com).

**2. Keep your jam jars**

Following the success of last year, we’re repeating the Jam Jar Stall. At the Jam Jar stall we ask you to fill a jam jar with small sweets (and toys/small items if you want) which we’ll then sell on the day of the fayre. So save up any jam jars now!
