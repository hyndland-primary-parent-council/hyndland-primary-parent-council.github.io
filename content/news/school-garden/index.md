# School Garden

[August 22, 2014](news/school-garden/) [admin](author/admin/)

At Hyndland Primary we are keen to promote outdoor learning. The school garden is currently maintained by green fingered parent Helen Rolph, but she needs help. Would you be able to volunteer some of your time? She is always looking for volunteers to help out not just in the school garden, but with the playgrounds too. You could water the gardens and pots (especially the pots at the main door, which is now covered by scaffolding), help with planting, digging and preparing plants and seeds for classes.

The school garden has also been opening up after school one day a week to encourage the children to do some gardening, and if anyone is available to help out with that it would be great.

Helen will be looking for parent volunteers to help her with the gardening projects, so whether or not you are good with a trowel or can tell the difference between a plant and a weed, all-comers are welcome. If you are interested, please email Helen at [hjrolph@gmail.com](mailto:hjrolph@gmail.com).

We would also like to say a big THANK YOU to Amanda Storey, who has moved on as her daughter left HPS in the summer for secondary school. Amanda did a fantastic job with the school garden and numerous gardening projects with pupils at the school over several years, and we’re very sorry to see her go, but are reassured that the garden is in Helen’s very capable horticultural hands Thanks for all of your hard and creative work, Amanda!
