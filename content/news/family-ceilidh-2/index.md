Come along and have some fun at the St Andrews Night (nearly!) Family Ceilidh on **Friday 21st November**

**7.00-10.00pm at Partick Burgh Halls**

We need food donations for the buffet. It will be mostly party food as it tends to be the kids that eat most of it!!

We are also looking for raffle prizes – if you have any suitable prizes, for kids as well as adults, please bring along on the night.

Tickets limited to 3 children per adult.

NO unaccompanied children will be allowed in.

Please note: no advanced ticket sales, tickets on the door on the night: Adult £4, Child £2
