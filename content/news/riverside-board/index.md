# Riverside Board

[March 2, 2014](/news/riverside-board/) [admin](author/admin/)

Congratulations to our Riverside Board members, who spent last Monday ‘Taking Over’ GOMA in the city centre, our children were featured on the radio and in the media – a host of lovely photos will be available for you to see on our school website when it launches at the end of the week!
