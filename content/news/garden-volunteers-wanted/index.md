# Garden Volunteers Wanted

[March 2, 2014](/news/garden-volunteers-wanted/) [admin](author/admin/)

We would like to make an excellent outdoor learning experience for the children at Hyndland Primary and at the Afty.

We are always looking for volunteers to help out, not just in the school garden, but with the playgrounds too. So you may not have green fingers, but if you are good at fixing stuff / building things (e.g. planters, benches) or would like to paint some murals to brighten up the playgrounds we would really like to hear from you.

You can contact [Helen Gibson](mailto:hjrolph@gmail.com) for further details.

If youâ€™d like to see some general info about the garden, take a look at our website at [hpaschoolgarden.wordpress.com](http://hpaschoolgarden.wordpress.com "The Garden")
