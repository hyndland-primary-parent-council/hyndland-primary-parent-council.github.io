# [Fundraising Committee](/news/fundraising-committee/)

[August 23, 2012](/news/fundraising-committee/) [admin](author/admin/)

Tuesday 4th September from 9pm, Cottiers Bar, Hyndland Street

The Parent Councilâ€™s Fundraising Committee organises several social events throughout the school year in order to get everyone together, make friends and collect funds to help the school.

The Fundraising Team currently&nbsp; **needs more volunteers** to help with the events! If you would like to give us a hand and support the school at the same time, please contact [Marie Tate](mailto:marie.tate@ntlworld.com).

The team meets at 9pm at Cottiers on the first Tuesday of the month. Come along! Any help or input, big or small, is very welcome!
