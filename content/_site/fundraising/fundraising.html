<p>The Parent Council’s Fundraising Committee organises several social events throughout the school year in order to get everyone together, make friends and collect funds to help the school.</p>

<p>The Fundraising Team always appreciates more volunteers to help with the events! If you would like to give us a hand and support the school at the same time, please <a href="mailto:enquiries@hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org">email</a> us.</p>

<p>Any help or input, big or small, is very welcome!</p>
