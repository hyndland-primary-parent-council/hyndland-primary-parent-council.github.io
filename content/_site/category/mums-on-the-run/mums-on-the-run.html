<h1 id="hyndland-parent-council-quiz-night"><a href="news/hyndland-parent-council-quiz-night/">Hyndland Parent Council Quiz Night</a></h1>

<p><a href="news/hyndland-parent-council-quiz-night/">September 6, 2017</a> <a href="author/admin/">admin</a></p>

<p><strong>Friday 29 September</strong> sees the return of the Parent Council Quiz Night, hosting by our very own Mums on the Run at  <strong>Partick Bowling Club</strong> (right next door to the school).</p>

<p>Starting at <strong>7.30pm</strong> (adults only, no kids allowed!), tickets ( <strong>£5</strong> ) are available from Louise Love in the playground. Entry is also available by payment on the door on the night.</p>

<p>Also, please either bring along raffle prizes on the night, or, if you can’t make it but would like to contribute, please leave raffle prizes / donations in the school office and then email <a href="mailto:hyndlandmotr@gmail.com">hyndlandmotr@gmail.com</a> or <a href="mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk">john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk</a> so that we know they are there!</p>

<p>Raffle prizes could include such items as bottles, gift vouchers, chocolates, and anything else that you can think of.</p>

<p>Please also bring along nibbles for the buffet, as pub quizzes can be hungry – as well as thirsty – work!</p>

<p>Thanks, and please come along, meet other parents and carers and demonstrate your powers of trivia while having a drink and a laugh.</p>
