<h1 id="music-club">Music Club</h1>

<p><strong>Unfortunately, due to current government guidelines, the Music Club will not be able to start back yet.</strong>  <strong>We will keep you updated and hopefully we will be able to resume lessons  in October.</strong></p>

<p><strong>REEL KIDS MUSIC CLUB – CIC</strong><br />
The Reel Kids Music Club Community Interest Company is an independent provider of after school music classes for primary aged children in Glasgow. Weekly classes offer the opportunity for group learning on a variety of instruments for P3-7 children as well as singing in a choir. The Club offers Mini classes to P2 children which are based on a Kodály approach to music education and include songs, circle games and percussion activities which develop fundamental music skills for learning an instrument.</p>

<p><strong>MINI MUSIC CLUB</strong><br />
This runs every week from 3.20-4.15pm. There are approx. 25-30 spaces each year. It provides the opportunity to learn basic musical concepts which will help children should they move onto the main Music Club. The class focuses on developing the children’s pulse, rhythm and singing. The children do not learn an instrument. This is a musicianship class and they learn important skills through playing musical games.</p>

<p><strong>MUSIC CLUB</strong><br />
The club runs every week from 3.20-4.20pm. Instruments that are currently taught are VIOLIN, FLUTE, WHISTLE, GUITAR AND DJEMBE. All children have 30 minutes of instrumental lesson and 30 minutes of choir. Singing is a vital part of learning music and the children benefit hugely from singing together as well as working in groups.</p>

<p><strong>AGES TAUGHT</strong><br />
The Music Club is currently open to P3’s – P7’s.<br />
The Mini Music Club runs for P2’s and P3’s.</p>

<p><strong>HYNDLAND ENSEMBLE</strong><br />
The ensemble was set up to give instrumental players in the school the opportunity to play on a weekly basis. The ensemble practice for an hour on Monday at 2.15 under the direction of composer Andrew Cruickshank.<br />
The Ensemble is open to P5-P7 children whether they learn at school, privately or at Music Club. String, brass and woodwind players are welcome to join as long as they can read music.</p>
