<p><strong>LEAVERS DISCO, Thurs 22 June, 7-8.30pm</strong></p>

<p>Over the last four years parents have run the P7 Leavers Disco. It used to be run by the school, however in 2013 the P7s decided they wanted something a little more special. There is a disco with games, bought in pizza, drinks and snacks and the gym hall is decorated specially for the evening. Last year the P7 parents also introduced leavers’ t-shirts which were very popular with the kids. The P7s also get a leavers’ present. This year it will be a scientific calculator, which all pupils use at secondary.</p>

<p>The Parent Council put money towards the leavers’ presents and the party, but we need to ask P7 parents to make a donation towards the overall costs. The cost will be approx. £7 but will be confirmed once we find a DJ and cost the t-shirts.</p>

<p><strong>HELP NEEDED – For the Leavers Disco to be a success we need your help!</strong></p>

<p>Are there any P7 parents who are DJs or do you know a good DJ that is free on the 22nd? If so, get in touch.</p>

<p>We will need between 4-6 parent volunteers to help on the afternoon of the 22nd to set up the gym and also 4-6 volunteers to help out during the disco.</p>

<p>Before the disco it would be good to also have a group of parents to help organise it, including ordering the pizzas, buying snacks and decorations and sorting out the goody bags.</p>

<p>If you have any other ideas that could make the Disco memorable, we’d be happy to hear about them too. One year they had a photo booth!</p>

<p>If you can help at all, please contact Lorne Bourhill (P7 Parent Council Rep), saying what you would like to be involved in.</p>

<p><strong>P7 YEARBOOK</strong></p>

<p>The school will also produce a very simple yearbook with photos of the pupils from P1 and P7. Please could you send in a photo of your child when they started school, even if your child was at a different school in P1. The photos will be scanned and returned to you.</p>

<p>Please let the school know if you don’t want your child’s photo to be included in the yearbook.</p>
