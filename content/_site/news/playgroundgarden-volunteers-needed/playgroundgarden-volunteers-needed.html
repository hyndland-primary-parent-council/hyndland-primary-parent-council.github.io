<p><strong>VOLUNTEERS NEEDED TO HELP OUT WITH THE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND AND GARDEN IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE EASTER BREAK</strong></p>

<p>School break is upon us – 3 potential weekends to carry out much needed tasks in order to improve playground areas.</p>

<p>However, on weekdays except for 13 &amp; 14 April, work improving the playground and garden will still be ongoing (weather permitting); therefore, help during the week would gladly be welcomed too.</p>

<p>There is a list of tasks to be carried out – which range from general cleaning to painting…</p>

<p>If there is anyone out there happy to spare a few hours during the hols, please text 07882 942945 with the date(s) you’re available and the approximate time you can come along.</p>

<p>Please note the following:</p>

<p>If you bring along your children then it’s likely they’ll be painting too, so please ensure suitable clothing is worn.</p>

<p>We would like to see a big difference this year in all the playground areas and have some cracking projects for the kids to get involved in.</p>

<p>If your kids come along to help during the hols then they will become the ‘trailblazers’ and inspire their friends and classmates once school resumes with these projects.</p>

<p>Please also bring along spare paint, paint brushes, etc.</p>

<p>The Afty building will also be available for shelter/toilet/hot drinks while the holiday club children are away on outings – currently planned for the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th. Any time between 10ish and 5ish.</p>

<p>Please come along and help out at some point during the holidays, even if it’s just for a couple of hours on a single day. The kids will probably love it too!</p>
