<p>On Friday 20 November, the Parent Council held our usual autumn Ceilidh, which was as ever a lot of fun for parents and children alike and is a great fundraiser for the school.</p>

<p>Special thanks should go to everyone who organised and prepared for the event, and helped out on the night through selling raffle and tombola tickets, taking admission fees and with food etc.</p>

<p>Further special thanks are also due to the people and/or businesses who generously donated raffle prizes.</p>

<p>On the night we took £920.47, of which £374.37 was profit after the hall hire and band costs were taken into account. This is an excellent contribution to the work the Parent Council does to support the school. Thank you to all of you who were involved in any way!</p>
