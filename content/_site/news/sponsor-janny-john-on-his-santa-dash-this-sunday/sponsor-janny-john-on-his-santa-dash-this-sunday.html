<p>This Sunday, 10 December, Hyndland Primary’s very own super-janny, the mighty Janny John, is taking part in Glasgow’s annual Santa Dash in George Square.</p>

<p>He is raising money for the Beatson Cancer Hospital and you can either cadge hold of him in the school playground to sponsor him, or pop into the school office and ask if you can leave sponsorship for him there.</p>

<p>Several other staff from the school are also taking part in what is both a fun-filled event and a good fund-raiser for an important charitable cause.</p>

<p>The fun kicks off at 9.30am and the starter pistol is fired at 10.00 am, whereupon a Ho, Ho! Herd (apparently, the collective noun for a group of Santas) of men, women and children adorned from tip to toe in St. Nick’s uniform, will charge, walk and toddle round George Square in a flurry of red robes, trousers and white beards.</p>

<p><strong>Good luck Janny Claus and school elves!</strong></p>
