<p>Janny Joe retires from the school on Friday 12 August, just before the school starts back. Ms Brown will let parents and carers know of any farewell arrangements.</p>

<p>A collection for a farewell gift for Joe from parents will take place over the summer, with the collection tin available until Thursday 11 August in the Afty.</p>

<p>Let’s show Janny Joe our appreciation of the 21 years of service he’s given to the school and our children.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>John Lewis, Chair, Hyndland Primary School Parent Council</p>
