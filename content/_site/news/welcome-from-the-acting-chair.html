<p><a href="news/welcome-from-the-acting-chair/">August 22, 2014</a> <a href="author/admin/">admin</a></p>

<p>A new school year and a whole host of new faces in P1 can be seen around the school, along with some other new faces dotted around the other years. Another ‘new’ face, at least in the role of Acting Chair of the Parent Council is that of myself. I have replaced – if that’s at all possible – Jane Grove, who did a fantastic job as Chair of the Parent Council. I’d like to thank Jane wholeheartedly for all of the work that she did for the school and for the advice that she’s given me in my new acting role over the summer holidays.</p>

<p>The work of the Parent Council, along with that of all the parents who contribute to its activities, is a collective effort, and we all have a vested interest in the fortunes of the school and in the positive experience of our children and the staff during our time at and with the school. So, I look forward to continue working with the Parent Council, the school and, most importantly, all of you as parents to ensure that Hyndland Primary School continues to provide a happy, healthy, enjoyable and appropriately challenging educational experience for all of our young people.</p>

<p>Involvement with the Parent Council, either as a Rep or attending meetings and other activities as a parent really is a great chance to find out what’s going on in the school. So, please do become involved and, should you wish to discuss any issues, please either get in touch with the Parent Rep for your child or children’s school year (or, indeed, any of the Parent Reps), or contact me at <a href="mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk">john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Parent Council I wish all of the children and staff at our school a successful and fun year, and hope that we will all enjoy the experience along with our children.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>John Lewis</p>
