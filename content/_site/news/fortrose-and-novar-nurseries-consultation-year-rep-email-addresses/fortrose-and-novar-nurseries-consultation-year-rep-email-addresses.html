<p>Glasgow City Council Education Services are currently consulting on a proposal to merge two of the nurseries that serve Hyndland Primary,  <strong>Novar Nursery </strong> and  <strong>Fortrose Nursery, </strong> moving to a new facility on the site of the former Broomhill Primary Annexe. Details of the proposal can be viewed <strong><a href="https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=51001&amp;p=0">HERE</a> </strong>and you can take part in the consultation <strong><a href="https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/Broomhill/">HERE.</a></strong></p>

<p>Following some feedback that people are finding it difficult to get in touch with their year rep, email links have been added for all reps. These may be found in the <a href="contact-us/">contact page</a>.</p>
