<p> </p>

<p>This autumn we’ve decided to hold a Halloween Disco for children and parents/carers, their families an school staff rather than a Ceilidh, so please come along to  <strong>Partick Burgh Halls on Friday 3rd November at 7pm</strong>.</p>

<p>Tickets for entry are available on the door on the night.</p>

<p>There is a cash bar.</p>

<p><strong>Raffle / Tombola / Lucky Dip Prizes</strong></p>

<p>Please help us by bringing along prizes for the raffle for the adults as well as smaller prizes for the tombola / lucky dip for the children.</p>

<p>Suggested raffle prizes could be bottles, chocolates, gift vouchers, toiletries, as well as any gifts that you may be able to get your company, employer, friends and family to donate for a good cause – which is to raise enough funds from this and other events to embark on some major playground improvements.</p>

<p>Suggested prizes for the children’s tombola / lucky dip could be small toys, games, sweets, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Food and Snacks for the children</strong></p>

<p>We also need donations on the night of party food for the children, for example, sandwiches, pizza, crisps, cocktail sausages, sausage rolls and vegetarian alternatives, biscuits, cakes, vegetable sticks, etc.</p>

<p>For the last two ceilidhs we’ve had to dip heavily into the evening’s takings to buy food for the children as well as tombola prizes, which substantially reduces the profit that we make, which is used for improvements in the learning experience for all of our children, so please bring food along and please could you notify  <strong>Alan Bonnyman</strong>  (<a href="mailto:abonnyman23@hotmail.com">abonnyman23@hotmail.com</a>),   <strong>Nadia Miller</strong>  (poster for details) or  <strong>John Lewis</strong>  (<a href="mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk">john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk</a>) if you’re able to bring buffet food along.</p>

<p><strong>PLEASE, NO FOOD OR TREATS WITH NUTS IN!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Halloween Decorations</strong></p>

<p>As it’s a Halloween themed party, could you please bring along any left over Halloween decorations that you might have, so that we can decorate the hall accordingly? Any pumpkin lanterns that you have left over would also be ideal for the tables.</p>

<p>Again, we don’t wish to use the money raised to pay for decorations, and it also allows you to recycle your decorations and pumpkins from 31st October. If you are able to donate your Halloween decorations, please could you bring them along to the hall anytime after 6pm on the night and certainly ideally before the doors open at 7pm?</p>

<p><strong>Volunteers Needed</strong></p>

<p>Finally, we are looking for volunteers to help out on the door, setting up food, the raffle and tombola / lucky dip, and clearing up at the end of the evening, so please contact Alan, John or Nadia if you’re able to help.</p>

<p>Please bring along your children, family and friends to ensure that it’s a great night for the kids, for you, and for fundraising for the school.</p>

<p>Thanks and  <strong>WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU THERE!</strong></p>
