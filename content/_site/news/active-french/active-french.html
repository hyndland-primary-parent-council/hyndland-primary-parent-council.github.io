<p>Active French is growing! With just a few spaces left in after-school classes on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays for children in P2-P7, I am now able to offer places for an additional Thursday class which is particularly suitable for children in P1. Classes take place at Hyndland Primary but are also open to children from other schools and arrangements can be made for children who attend Afty to come along and join us.</p>

<p>Active French aims to introduce children to French in an exciting, stimulating way suited to their stage of development. Games, songs, action and movement enable the children to take an active part in their learning with the emphasis on fun.</p>

<p>Classes begin in August and the block runs until the October break. If you’re interested in a place for your child or would like further details please email Jane Grove: <a href="mailto:janegrove@btinternet.com">janegrove@btinternet.com</a> or phone 07732019428</p>
