<p>As everyone will by now know the school is to close after classes on Friday in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Please see the letter below from the Headteacher, Helen Brown, outlining plans for how the school will operate during the closure. This went home in schoolbags on Wednesday but as many children were already being kept off it may not have reached everyone.
