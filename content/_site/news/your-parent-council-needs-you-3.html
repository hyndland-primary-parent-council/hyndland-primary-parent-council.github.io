<p>Hyndland Primary School Parent Council is only as good as the support and involvement of those who contribute to it and the work of the wider Parent Forum. We are always looking for as wide a level of engagement between the Parent Council and wider Parent Forum as possible, whether that be funding ideas, ideas about improving the learning experience for the children at school, social activities, and no doubt the many things we haven’t yet thought of. So, please do approach Parent Council representatives with your comments, views and ideas and come along to the monthly meetings, or email us at: <a href="mailto:enquiries@hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org">enquiries@hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org</a></p>

<p><strong>The next meeting of the Parent Council is the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Wednesday 14 September at 7pm in the school canteen.</strong></p>

<p>At the AGM we will be looking for some new Parent Council representatives, including for P1, Secretary and Additional Member(s).</p>

<p>_ <strong>The parent voice is only as strong as the level of support it receives, so please come along and support us!</strong> _</p>
