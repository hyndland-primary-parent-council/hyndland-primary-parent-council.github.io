<p>Children are invited to come along with their red noses and wearing something red for this year’s Comic Relief Red Nose Day. Donations of £1 (for non-uniform) will be collected for Comic Relief. Please note that this is instead of the usual last-Friday-in-the-month event (along with World Book Day this makes two dress-up events in March) and there will NOT be a non-uniform day at the end of March.</p>
