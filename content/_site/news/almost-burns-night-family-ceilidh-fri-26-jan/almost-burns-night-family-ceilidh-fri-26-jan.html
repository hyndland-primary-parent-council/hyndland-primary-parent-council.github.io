<p>Come along to the Ceilidh and celebrate it nearly being Burns’ Night.</p>

<p>We are looking for volunteers to help out getting raffle and tombola prizes prior to the night and/or to help out on the night, taking door money, selling raffle tickets, setting up and clearing up at the end.</p>

<p>We need food donations for the children’s (and adults’) food buffet. No nuts in the food please!</p>

<p>There is no cash bar, so please bring your own bottle. There is a Sainsbury’s express supermarket next door and several off licences in the close vicinity.</p>

<p>Soft drinks for the children, non-drinkers and designated drivers will be available for free on the night for as long as the stocks last.</p>

<p>Please see the poster above and flyers that will be posted around the school for further info.</p>

<p>Come along and support your Parent Council while having a fun night out with the kids!</p>
