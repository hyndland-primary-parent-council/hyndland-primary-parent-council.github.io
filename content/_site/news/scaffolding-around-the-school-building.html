<p>It could hardly have escaped anyone’s attention that the school is practically surrounded by scaffolding. This went up over the summer holidays and is in place to enable some of the planned work to make sure that the school is windproof and water-tight. This is part of GCC’s ‘4R’s’ Estate Strategy (Right Schools, Right Size, Right Place, Right Time). Repairs are being made to leaks coming in through the roof, along with some stone work and new guttering and downpipes.</p>

<p>The scaffolding is due to come down around mid-September.</p>

<p>All being equal, it should hopefully reappear in January 2015, which the City Council have given the school as the start date to more extensive 4R’s work, including further work to the exterior of the building and a full internal refurbishment. The work will be undertaken without the need to decamp from the school, as classes will be moved into different rooms as they are refurbished.</p>

<p>Further details will be made available closer as the school is given confirmation of the start date.</p>
