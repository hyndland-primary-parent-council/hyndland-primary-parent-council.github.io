<p>Now that the good weather is around (for a bit anyway), here are a few garden activities that are going on:</p>

<p><strong>School garden and P1 playground</strong><br />
Kate O’Brien and family and friends have been busy digging over the flower beds in the school garden. They have got a few pots together they will put down in the P1 playground and then plant up so that it is a bit brighter for the P1s when they are outside.</p>

<p><strong>Pots around the playgrounds</strong><br />
We’ve had a few volunteers helping with planting some bedding plants in the P2 &amp; P3 playground pots.</p>

<p><strong>Adopt A Pot</strong><br />
_ <strong>Would you like to help out with the school garden but don’t have much time?</strong> _ You could adopt a plant pot. This would not take up much time (a bit of planting and then just watering). Just pick one of the many pots around the school (big or small), paint the pot, choose a plant and watch it bloom!</p>

<p><strong>If you’d like your child to experience some outdoor learning (and have some fun), please feel free to take them up to the school garden after school. There’s lots to do in the garden such as digging over the soil, finding bugs and putting them in the bug hotel or just sitting in the sunshine (there is a nice bench at the top of the garden!).</strong></p>
