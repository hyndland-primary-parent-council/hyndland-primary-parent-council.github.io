<p><strong>This year Hyndland Mums on the Run are </strong> raising funds to send each class at Hyndland Primary to Scotstoun Stadium to experience what it’s like to compete in a professional athletics arena: running on a real track, doing field events in a 5000-seater stadium, and using the same facilities as many of Team Scotland’s athletes. As a Glasgow school we get use of the stadium for free, but it costs £150 to pay for a bus to get the kids up there. Can you help? From October 23-27, Mums on the Run are getting their families and friends to get out and run a sponsored 5k to help pay for this amazing opportunity. Quite literally, we’re all running for a bus. Please sponsor us!</p>

<p>We have an online giving page here: <a href="https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/6t4Ue/em/b22wx8" title="Mums on the Run Fundrazr Page">https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/6t4Ue/em/b22wx8</a> or feel free to pass on a donation to one of our runners.</p>
