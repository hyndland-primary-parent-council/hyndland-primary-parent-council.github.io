<p>Tuesday 25th June<br />
Hyndland Parish Church (near Top Tier and Pizza Magic)<br />
9.45am</p>

<p>Some volunteers to walk classes up to church would be appreciated. Meet at 9am in school. Everyone else, we’ll see you there. Please remember to use back pews as front ones are reserved for pupils and staff. Thanks to Rachel for driving the djembes. This one promises to be an emotional one as we say goodbye not only to our P7 leavers as they head off for higher things… but also to long-standing members of staff and parents who have given many years of their time in volunteering. Bring a tissue!</p>
