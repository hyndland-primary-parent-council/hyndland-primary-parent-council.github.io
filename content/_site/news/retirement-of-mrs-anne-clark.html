<p>Hyndland Primary will be sad to lose Mrs Anne Clark, a much-loved teacher, who due to ill health will be retiring this summer. Pupils, parents and families will have the opportunity to sign a memories book for Mrs Clark and may wish to contribute to the collection for flowers and a gift which will be presented at the End of Term Church Service. Contributions can be posted into the Parent Council box next to the office and Jane will also be collecting in the playground over the next week.</p>
