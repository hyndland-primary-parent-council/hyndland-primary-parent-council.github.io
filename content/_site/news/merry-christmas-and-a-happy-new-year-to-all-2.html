<p>It’s almost that time of year again, when our homes are bright and sparkly and invariably smell of fresh pine; stockings are hung out to be filled and children all over the world are awaiting the impending arrival of Father Christmas.</p>

<p>Only a few short days until we come to the end of another successful term at Hyndland Primary School, the children are undoubtedly tired and in need of a rest before the holiday excitement really kicks off, and so, no doubt are all the staff!</p>

<p>The last few weeks have been a hive of activity, from the Parent Council Ceilidh to the P1-3 Christmas play, not to mention the Christmas Service and the Panto.</p>

<p>I think we can say well done to all the children and staff at the school and also to the parents contributing to the activities and fundraising in various ways. Thank you!</p>

<p>While it was unfortunate that the Christmas Fayre had to be postponed to a celebration in the spring, the Parent Council both understands and supports the school’s decision. I think it is very important to add that the Parent Council also  <strong>fully supports </strong> Janny John and the other Glasgow janitors in their industrial action. While the ongoing action has put some additional pressure on the school, the jannies’ action is based on what has effectively become the creation of a two-tier workforce doing the same or a similar job and the jannies’ claim for an annual Working Context and Demands payment of between £500-£1,000 per year. If they had been direct employees of Glasgow City Council, instead of its arms-length body, Cordia, they would likely have received it.</p>

<p>The Parent Council sends them our best wishes for success and for common sense at Cordia and Glasgow City Council to prevail.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Parent Council may we wish you all a Merry Christmas and a peaceful holiday and a Happy New Year, and we look forward to seeing you all in 2017!</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p>John Lewis<br />
Chair, Hyndland Primary School Parent Council</p>
