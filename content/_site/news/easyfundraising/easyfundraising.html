<p>One of the ways you can help fundraise for the school without any extra expenditure is to shop online via <a href="http://easyfundraising.org.uk/" title="EasyFundraising">http://easyfundraising.org.uk/</a>. This is a really easy way to see that the school benefits from something you do anyway. We have already raised over £260 with easyfundraising in the last year from just a handful of parents. If more parents used this to shop online, we could raise much more for school resources that will benefit all of our children.</p>

<p>Over 2,700 well known retailers like Amazon, Argos, M&amp;S and Sainsbury’s (and many more!) are involved, and whenever you buy something online from them, the retailer makes a donation to your chosen good cause.</p>

<p><strong>It doesn’t cost you a single penny extra.</strong></p>

<p>Sign up now using this link: <a href="http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/invite/2BLQGE" title="easyfundraising invite link">http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/invite/2BLQGE</a> – this will register you as an invited friend, and when you raise £10, an extra £5 will be added by easyfundraising.</p>

<p>Once you use the above link, type ‘Hyndland Primary School’ into the search field and select ‘Hyndland Primary School Parent Council – Glasgow’. There are very few details to fill in and it takes only a few minutes. It works by you either initially going through the easyfundraising link to the site that you want, or using the easyfundraising donation reminder toolbar (<a href="http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/raise-more/donation-reminder/" title="easyfundraising donation reminder toolbar">http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/raise-more/donation-reminder/</a>), which you can install in your browser. This will let you know when a website is an easyfundraising partner, making it even easier to receive donations while you’re shopping!</p>

<p>Please spread the word among your friends and family, and with Christmas shopping on the horizon, you have more opportunities to raise even more to help benefit the school!</p>
