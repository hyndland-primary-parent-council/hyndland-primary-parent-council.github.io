<p>As the holidays approach, we usually put together a watering rota for the school garden. If you are free to take your children down to the garden on a particular day or week over the summer to water the plants, please let us know as this will be a great help. The same also applies if you’re able to come along and help out with playground improvements or gardening during the holidays.</p>

<p>Please email or phone either Helen Rolph (<a href="mailto:hjrolph@gmail.com">hjrolph@gmail.com</a> / 07811 384083) or Susan Taylor (<a href="mailto:matboffice@yahoo.co.uk">matboffice@yahoo.co.uk</a> / 07882 942945) if you are able to help out with the garden and playground work over the summer and beyond.</p>

<p>Very best wishes</p>

<p><em>Helen and Susan</em></p>
