<p>After a month of weekly team runs, muddy trainers and shameless scrounging for sponsorship, we finally did it, and then some. The FundRazr tally stands at £695, there’s around £160 in cash coming in, there are some collecting tins knocking around and there’s still time for people to donate if they haven’t done so already.</p>

<p><a href="https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/dcMX8">https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/dcMX8</a> – the online giving page closes at midnight tonight.</p>

<p>We beat our target of a combined average of 30 mins – our time was actually 27:58. Fantastic!</p>

<p>Everyone should be thoroughly chuffed with themselves and absolutely proud of what the efforts of 12 mums can achieve for our kids’ school. A huge thanks goes out to all our sponsors for their generosity, not to mention their patience in not going nuts at all the email/Facebook/text reminders they received to remind them to donate. And to An Clachan Cafe – you gave us the greatest gift of all: coffee and cake. Sorry to your regular customers today.</p>

<p>The money will go towards sports equipment – mobile badminton/tennis/volleyball nets and basketball hoops, hoola-hoops, stuff that can be used in the playground – and a set of waterproofs for the kids.</p>

<p>Well done everyone.</p>

<p>Next run is next Wednesday. Come and join us!</p>
