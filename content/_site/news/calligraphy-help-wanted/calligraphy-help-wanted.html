<p>Each year the Parent Council presents a French dictionary to P7 Leavers as they move onto Secondary School. We’re looking for someone to inscribe the names of Leavers in the dictionaries. Do you know anyone with gorgeous writing? Please contact Catherine Harte (Depute) or Linda McCormick if you or someone you know would be willing to write 66 names into dictionaries to be ready for the end of next week.</p>
