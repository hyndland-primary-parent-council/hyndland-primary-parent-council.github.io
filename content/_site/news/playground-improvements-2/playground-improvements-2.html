<p>We’ve fixed a date for Spring Clean #2<br />
<strong>Sunday 23rd June, 10am-2pm</strong></p>

<p>You will have seen the great work achieved during the Spring Clean. We have a few things to finish off and have arranged a date to crack on with those, hopefully having everything ready before we break up for the summer holidays. These include: a willow gazebo and a wall mounted chalkboard to go up, the last music stand and the benches to be sited.</p>

<p><strong>If you could lend a hand on the day, please email Jane</strong>. Afty will be open for refreshments for the workers and we hope that those of you who couldn’t make it along last time but fancy lending a hand will give it a go.</p>
