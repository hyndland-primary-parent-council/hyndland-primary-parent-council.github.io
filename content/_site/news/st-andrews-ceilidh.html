<p>Friday 30th November, 7-10pm, Partick Burgh Halls</p>

<p>Hurry, hurry! If you haven’t got your ticket request in yet there’s still time but don’t delay as the ceilidh is always a really popular event. Tickets £4 for adults, £2 for children are available from Jane in the playground (mostly at 3.15 rather than in the morning). Donations to the party food buffet and raffle gifts for children or adults gratefully received.</p>
