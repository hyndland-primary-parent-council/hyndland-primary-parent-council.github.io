<p><a href="news/playground-help-needed/">October 5, 2012</a> <a href="author/admin/">admin</a></p>

<p><strong>Sunday 7th October, from 10am</strong></p>

<p><strong>As part of our ongoing commitment to improving the playground we are looking for some strong chaps to lay astroturf in the top playground.</strong></p>

<p>On Saturday the eroded ground by the trees along the fence is going to be in-filled and levelled by contractors. On Sunday, weather permitting, we need to lay the council-donated astroturf. The rolls of astroturf weigh one and a half tons… so we need at least 10 volunteers to complete the job. The current astroturf in the middle playground has proved extremely popular with the children. Let’s make a difference to the top playground too.</p>

<p><strong>Can you help? Email <a href="mailto:janegrove@btinternet.com">Jane</a> if you can make it.</strong></p>
