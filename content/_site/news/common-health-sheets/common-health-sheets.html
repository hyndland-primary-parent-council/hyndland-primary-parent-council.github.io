<p>Common Health Challenge was launched the week the baton arrived, with children completing 3 events each week to gain a gold award at the end of the third week. If your child chose to take part and you haven’t signed and returned the sheet to their class teacher yet, please do so by the end of the week so that they can get their Gold Award!</p>
