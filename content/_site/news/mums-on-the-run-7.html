<p>MOTR has so far raised almost £2000 for sport and outdoor activities at Hyndland. This year many families from school took part in ‘Five Go Running’. The event aimed to get more people out running, at the same time as raising funds to send all our classes to use the world class athletics facilities at Glasgow’s Emirates Stadium. For the latter our runners raised £630, enabling a trip for all P5-7 classes in the summer term, with this year’s P1-4 heading there next term.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best thing about the event was the number of Hyndland pupils who took part across P1-P7.</p>

<p>A huge thanks to all our runners and sponsors this year – your volunteering and fundraising efforts help make Hyndland the great wee community it it. The group will be back running again next term, but this time we’ll meet on a Friday morning.</p>
