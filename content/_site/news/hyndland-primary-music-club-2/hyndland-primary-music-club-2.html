<p><strong>A message from Naheed:</strong></p>

<p>Your child will start with choir  <strong>in the dining hall</strong> for 30 minutes. Please remind them to go here when the bell rings.</p>

<p>After 30 minutes they will go to their instrumental lesson. There will be parent helpers to direct them to the appropriate classroom.</p>

<p>Pick up is from the playground at 4.20om prompt.</p>

<p>If they have a folder from last year, please remind them to bring it on Monday.</p>

<p>Best wishes</p>

<p>Naheed</p>
