<p>We’re saying goodbye to Ms Laville, Miss Miller and Mrs Francis as they begin their retirement and Mrs Kerr who has been promoted to Head Teacher at Sandwood Primary School. Presentations will be made from the children and families at the end of term service.</p>

<p><strong>If you would like to make a contribution, please do so by Friday.</strong>  Jane will be collecting in the playground, or you can post an envelope marked “Staff leavers” in the Parent Council box next to the office.</p>

<p><strong>Books for your messages and memories are in the school office during the day and in the playground at pick-up. These will be available until Monday.</strong></p>
