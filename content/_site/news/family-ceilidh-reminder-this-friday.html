<p><strong>A reminder that the Hyndland Primary Family Ceilidh is this Friday!</strong></p>

<p>Friday 20 May, 7-10pm in Partick Burgh Halls<br />
Ceilidh band starts 7.30pm<br />
Tickets on the door – £4 adults, £2 children<br />
Maximum 3 children per adult<br />
NO UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN<br />
Licenced bar</p>

<p>The Family Ceilidh is Hyndland Primary’s most popular social event, and it’s a great event for all the family. It’s a chance to get together with other parents, and maybe even have a dance. The whole event is geared up for the children – they take part in the dancing, hog the buffet and spend all your spare change on the tombola.</p>

<p><strong>FOOD!</strong> If you are coming, please bring along food suitable for a children’s buffet. Pre-cooked or cold, “finger” food only please (we don’t have cutlery or cooking facilities). Generally people bring pizza (pre-cooked and cut), biscuits, crisps, small cakes. Please remember NO NUTS.</p>

<p><strong>TOMBOLA!</strong> Please also bring something suitable for the kids tombola. If everyone could bring at least two or three things – they can be very small items or small toys/books/gifts etc.</p>

<p><strong>RAFFLE!</strong> We’re also running a raffle – please hassle anyone you know who might give us a meal in a restaurant or shop/hairdressers/beauty voucher.</p>

<p><strong>VOLUNTEERS!</strong> The more folk who help out, the less work it is for everyone. If you’re able to help lay out the buffet, monitor the plate filling or sell raffle tickets, please speak to Wendy at the desk in the entrance hall when you come in. We’d also really like to find a special volunteer to run the tombola.</p>

<p><strong>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</strong> The money raised will go towards plants for the pots in the playground, so that all the pupils can have the experience of gardening this term; P7 leavers’ presents (we’re academically mind, they all get scientific calculators for secondary school); new buddy hats and new homework folders.</p>
