<p>Main event:  <strong>Wednesday 6th November</strong></p>

<p>First training session:  <strong>Wednesday 9th October</strong> (after drop-off)</p>

<p>P3 Mum, Louise Love, explains how this fundraising initiative is going to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on Wednesday November 6 after drop we’re going to run a 5K to raise money for the school;</li>
  <li>our aim as a group is to get a combined average time of 30 mins or less;</li>
  <li>each runner should aim to raise £30 sponsorship and each runner will contact a local business or organisation to see if they will sponsor us £30 if we meet our target;</li>
  <li>we contact bigger organisations to see if they would match the funds we raise</li>
</ul>

<p>We’re going to have our first run as a group on Wednesday 9th after drop-off. Would you like to join us? Spread the word if you know any others who would like to come along. Some of the mums will probably run a bit and walk a bit; my intention is to take the group for a run along to Kelvingrove Park and back to school.</p>

<p>If you fancy joining Louise and the other runners (even if you missed the first training session!), then you can contact her to find out more and obtain a sponsorship form at <a href="mailto:scottishchick72@hotmail.com">scottishchick72@hotmail.com</a>. The more the merrier, and DADS are welcome too!</p>
