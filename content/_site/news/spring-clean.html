<p>Sunday 18th May</p>

<p>10am – 4pm</p>

<p>It’s that time of year again. Our fabulous garden organisers have a list of tasks they need help with and the playground has some new and exciting projects which need willing volunteers. We have a wonderful group of regulars who come along <em>en famille</em> every year to join in the effort on the day. If you could help and fancy being one of them this year, please sign up by letting Jane know.</p>

<p>It’s always helpful if volunteers can bring along their own gardening gloves (though we’ll have some to lend) and if you have a drill kit, tool kit, gardening spaces, secateurs or a broom… they will all come in handy. We’ll be hanging planters, trimming hedges, building sheds and lots more.</p>

<p>Lunch and tea and coffee breaks will be in the Afty. Many thanks to Fiona Ansdell for organising someone to open up and let us use the facilities.</p>

<p>Children are welcome to attend (it’s fab to join your family and pals in sprucing up your school), but remain the responsibility of the accompanying adult at all times.</p>
