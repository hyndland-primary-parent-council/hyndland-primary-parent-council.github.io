<p>At long last Glasgow City Council has published the outcome of its consultation, so from the letter received, we understand that the traffic calming measures on Fortrose Street and the changes to traffic and parking on Gardner Street and White Street should now go ahead. You will probably have seen the signs going up around parts of the West End notifying people that new traffic and parking regulations will be coming soon.</p>

<p>We have contacted Glasgow City Council and asked if they can prioritise the work on Fortrose Street, Gardner Street and White Street for health and safety reasons.</p>

<p>The following link shows the changes to the original plan: <a href="https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=16995">https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=16995</a></p>
