<p>Glasgow City Council have now published their traffic management/parking plan for around the school and the wider Partick-Partickhill-Dowanhill area. You may have seen the notices posted around the affected streets. We’re interested in this from a road safety around the school entrances point of view and we will formulate a response and share it with you prior to the  <strong>consultation deadline of 8 March</strong>.</p>

<p>The plans can be seen here: <a href="https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=16995">https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=16995</a></p>
