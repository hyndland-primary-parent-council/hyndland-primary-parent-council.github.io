<p>One of the ways you can help fundraise for the school without any extra expenditure is to shop online via <a href="https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/hyndlandprimary/">https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/hyndlandprimary/</a>. This is a really easy way to see that the school benefits from something you do anyway.  <strong>We have already raised over £830.26 with easyfundraising in the 3 years from just 37 people</strong>. There are over 400 individual parents and carers at the school (not to mention teachers and other staff), so if more people signed up and used this to shop online, we could raise much more for school resources that will benefit all of our children.</p>

<p>Over 2,700 well known retailers like Amazon, Argos, M&amp;S, John Lewis, Apple, Sainsbury’s, Boots, Currys PC World, Argos, Easyjet Holidays (there are other retailers!), and many more are involved, and whenever you buy something online from them, the retailer makes a donation to your chosen good cause.</p>

<p><strong><em>It doesn’t cost you a single penny extra!</em></strong></p>

<p>Sign up now using this link: <a href="http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/invite/2BLQGE">http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/invite/2BLQGE</a> – this will register you as an invited friend, and when you raise £10, an extra £5 will be added by easyfundraising.</p>

<p>Once you use the above link, type ‘Hyndland Primary School’ into the search field and select ‘Hyndland Primary School Parent Council – Glasgow’.  There are very few details to fill in and it takes only a few minutes. It works by you either initially going through the easyfundraising link to the site that you want, or using the easyfundraising donation reminder toolbar (<a href="http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/raise-more/donation-reminder/">http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/raise-more/donation-reminder/</a>), that you can install on your browser. This will let you know when a website is an easyfundraising partner, making it even easier to receive donations while you’re shopping!</p>

<p><strong>MERRY CHRISTMAS!</strong></p>
