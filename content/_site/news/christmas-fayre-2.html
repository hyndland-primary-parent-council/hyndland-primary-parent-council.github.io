<p>It’s all change this year. Fayre is  <strong>Friday 13th December</strong> … but the children and staff are running the whole shebang! Letter should be coming out soon regarding donations etc. (toys, books, bric-a-brac, home-baking) but children planning to run the stalls themselves: a fantastic enterprise opportunity. Any questions: ask Ms Kelly. We’ll be invited along in the afternoon as usual and if they have a panic induced by influx of donations we may need to send in some crack troops to help sort… but otherwise, have the usual clearout, keep and afternoon of the 13th free, sit back and RELAX!</p>
