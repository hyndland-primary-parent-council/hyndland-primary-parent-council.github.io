<p>Due to various clashing commitments, the Parent Council meeting scheduled for 26 October has been moved back to Wednesday 2 November. Also, in order to allow sufficient time between this meeting and the next, the originally scheduled meeting for Wednesday 23 November has been postponed until Wednesday 30 November. Both meetings will take place from 7pm to 8.30pm in the school staff room.</p>
