<p><a href="news/ceilidh-night-success-2/">December 19, 2016</a> <a href="author/admin/">admin</a></p>

<p>On Friday 2 December the Parent Council held our usual Autumn Ceilidh, which was a couple of weeks later than usual due to a combination of the new venue’s availability and also that of the ceilidh band.</p>

<p>However, while the turnout wasn’t as good as usual – which we think was largely down to its closeness to the Christmas holidays and clashes with parents’ staff Christmas nights out – it was as ever a lot of fun for children and parents and carers alike and is a great fundraiser for the Parent Council to help the school.</p>

<p>The event was organised by Nadia Miller and Wendy Jordan – thank you both for a great job! Special thanks also go to the many people helping out on the night through a large array of tasks,  everyone who brought food, raffle and tombola prizes, and all of the parents and carers, teachers and children who attended.</p>

<p>This was the first time that we used Hyndland Community Hall as a venue instead of Partick Burgh Halls. Although smaller, the hall does take up to about 150 people (according to the convenor) and I think that we probably had around 70-80 in the night, though perhaps I might need to work on my numeracy skills!</p>

<p>Using this venue and a BYOB approach was a bit of an experiment, but the hall hire was £350 cheaper and, all things considered, we think it went well and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves!</p>

<p>On the night we took £581.45, of which £196.45 was profit after the hall hire, band costs and soft drinks were taken into account.</p>

<p>This is an excellent contribution to the work the Parent Council does to support the school.  <strong>Thank you to all of you who were involved in any way!</strong></p>
