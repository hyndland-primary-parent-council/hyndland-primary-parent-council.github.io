<p>Save the date! The next family ceilidh is on Friday 20 May, 7pm-10pm at Partick Burgh Halls.</p>

<p>The Ceilidh is Hyndland Primary Parent Council’s most popular social event – its a great evening for all the family with dancing, buffet, kids tombola and an adult raffle. The money raised will go towards buddy hats, homework folders, and the dictionaries that are given to P7s when they leave this summer. We’ll be looking for volunteers to help on the night, for raffle and tombola gifts and for food for the buffet. Put the date in the diary, it’s sure to be a night to remember.</p>

<p>You can buy tickets on the door, only £4 for adults and £2 for children. A maximum of 3 children per adult. No unaccompanied children will be allowed in.</p>
