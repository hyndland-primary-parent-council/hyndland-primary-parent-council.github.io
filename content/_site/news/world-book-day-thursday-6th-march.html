<p>Next Thursday is World Book Day and we are hosting the Travelling Book Fair all week. On Thursday all our children and staff are invited to  <strong>dress as their favourite character from a text</strong> – this should be a fun day for us all! World Book Day vouchers (which will be issued to all pupils) can be used at the Book Fair or in a store of your own choice. All of our classes will be taking part in literacy rich activities next week, so let’s get ready to read! Thursday is also International School Meals Day – a flyer should come by school bag post advertising a special menu on 6th March.</p>

<p><strong>School are looking for Parent volunteers to run the book stall.</strong> If you can give some time – even an hour – between Wed 5th and Mon 10th March, please let Mrs McQuarrie know. A letter with return slip came home in school bags.</p>
