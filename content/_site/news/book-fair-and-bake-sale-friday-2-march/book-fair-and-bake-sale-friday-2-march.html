<p>The Parent Council is hosting a coffee afternoon in the school dining hall on Friday 2 March, 2-3pm. As part of the fundraising efforts for their leaving party, the P7 children are running a book and bake sale at that event.</p>

<p>The children are looking for book and baking donations to sell on the stall. If you have one or two books (in good condition, kids or grown-up titles) that you or your children would be happy to part with then please bring them into school by Thursday 1 March.</p>

<p>Also, if you would like to donate something for the cake stall, then please send it in with your child on March 2. (Please remember not to bring anything with nuts in!)</p>

<p>Hope to see you on the day!</p>
