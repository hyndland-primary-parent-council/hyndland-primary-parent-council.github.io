<p>We are a little team of six who are going to run  <strong>Glasgow’s Santa Dash</strong> on  <strong>8th December</strong> in a collective time of three hours or less.</p>

<p>Our aim is to raise £500 for Hyndland Primary School and have a bit of festive fun whilst we do it.</p>

<p>We shall be running in Santa suits and beards but will need to go as fast as Rudolph in the early hours of Christmas morning to meet our target, despite our fine selection of dodgy knees.</p>

<p>Who are we?</p>

<p>Three school mums, Linda, Catherine and Sarah</p>

<p>One game friend, Sandie</p>

<p>One step dad, Geoff</p>

<p>One very brave wee nine-year old, Finn</p>

<p>The dog in the photo is not running although he would love to. He is helping with the practice runs though.</p>
