<p>Hyndland Mums on the Run is holding an LP Run and bake-off competition on Friday December 11 at 9am. For those who have never done/heard of an LP run it works like this: the run takes place at a track and those taking part need to see how many times they can get round the track in 33 and a third minutes (hence, the LP tag!). The runners also run to the same playlist. Our track will be the West of Scotland Cricket Club and the playlist will be chosen by the MOTR mums. After the run everyone – runners and supporters – are invited back into school for coffee and a cake, and a vote to see whose home baking is the best of the bunch.</p>

<p>If you’d like to do the run (no skill required) or contribute to the bake-off (not necessarily any skill required) then please do!
