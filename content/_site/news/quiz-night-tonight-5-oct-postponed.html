<p>Apologies for the short notice, but unfortunately, due to availability of volunteers &amp; several parents/carers &amp; other groups of people indicating yesterday that they wouldn’t be able to make the Quiz Night tomorrow, we have taken the decision to postpone it. The last time we had such late notification we ran it at about one third capacity and made very little in terms of fund-raising and of course there were far fewer teams.</p>

<p>We’ll re-advertise once we have a new date and will probably need to consider a new approach.</p>
