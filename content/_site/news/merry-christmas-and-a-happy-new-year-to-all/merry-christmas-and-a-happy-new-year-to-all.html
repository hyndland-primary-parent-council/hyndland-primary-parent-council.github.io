<p>It’s almost that time of year again, when your homes are bright and sparkly and invariably smell of fresh pine; stockings are hung out to be filled and children all over are awaiting the impending arrival of Father Christmas.</p>

<p>Only a few short days until we come to the end of another successful term at Hyndland Primary School, the children are undoubtedly tired and in need of a rest before the holiday excitement really kicks off, and so, no doubt are all the staff!</p>

<p>The last few weeks have been a hive of activity, from the Parent Council Ceilidh to the P1-3 Christmas play; from the MOTR LP Run and Jingle Run to the Christmas Fayre; and from the Diamonds House term victory to the Panto and Magic Show.</p>

<p>I think we can say well done to all the children and staff at the school and also to the parents contributing to the activities and fundraising in various ways. Thank you!</p>

<p>On behalf of the Parent Council, may we wish you all a Merry Christmas and a peaceful holiday and a Happy New Year, and we look forward to seeing you all in 2016!</p>
