<p>Christmas Service Monday 16th December at Hyndland Parish Church at 9.45 – all welcome.</p>

<p>For those of you who have not been before, you will be directed to the back three or four pews so as to allow room for the children to sit with their class in the front rows.</p>

<p><strong>If you are able to accompany a class to church please speak to your child’s class teacher.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We’re also looking for someone to drive the djembes (drums) and music stands to the church and afterwards, to return them to school. Could that be you? Please contact <a href="mailto:janegrove@btinternet.com">Jane</a> if you can help.</strong></p>
