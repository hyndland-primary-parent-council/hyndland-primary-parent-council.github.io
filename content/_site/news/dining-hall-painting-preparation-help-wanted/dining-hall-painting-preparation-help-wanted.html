<p>We’re getting the Dining Hall painted during the summer holidays. If you are able to lend a hand on 16th-17/18th July or could spend some time before the end of term taking down posters etc. to prepare for painting, we’d love to hear from you. Contact <a href="mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk">John</a> or Mrs Kerr.</p>
