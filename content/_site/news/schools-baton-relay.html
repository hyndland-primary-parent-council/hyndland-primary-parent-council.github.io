<p>Hyndland Primary School is one of 70 schools across the city to be chosen to participate in the Schools Baton Relay which will mirror the Queen’s Baton Relay celebrating the Opening of the Commonwealth Games.</p>

<p>We will be given the baton by Notre Dame High School on Monday 4th Nov and will pass it on to Woodside Nursery on Friday 8th.</p>

<p>The baton will contain a message from the Lord Provost opened on arrival. The school will celebrate this event with a variety of activities across the school community and an information update will go out to parents.</p>
