<p><a href="news/welcome-from-the-chair/">August 20, 2015</a> <a href="author/admin/">admin</a></p>

<p>Welcome back to the new school year for those of you who have children returning, and welcome to your new school for those of you whose children are attending for the first time.</p>

<p>We have two new Depute heads to welcome, as well as several other new staff across the school. On behalf of the Parent Council and all of you as the wider Parent Forum, I wish them and all of the school staff all the best and our continued support over the coming year and beyond.</p>

<p>The work of the Parent Council, along with that of all the parents who contribute to its activities, is a collective effort and we all have a vested interest in the fortunes of the school and in the positive experience of our children and the staff during our time at and with the school. So, I look forward to continue working with the Parent Council, the school and, most importantly, all of you as parents to ensure that Hyndland Primary School continues to provide a happy, healthy, enjoyable and appropriately challenging educational experience for all of our young people.</p>

<p>Involvement with the Parent Council, either as a Parent Rep or attending meetings and other activities as a parent really is a great chance to find out what’s going on in the school. So, please do become involved and, should you wish to discuss any issues please either get in touch with the Parent Rep for your child or children’s school year (or, indeed, any of the Parent Reps), or contact me at <a href="mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk">john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk</a>.</p>
