<p>Thank you to everyone who attended the Mums on the Run Quiz Night on Friday 4 May at Partick Bowling Club. It was a great night. An excellent £527.24 was raised which will be put towards buying new buddy caps. The winning team were the Gangster Pandas.</p>

<p>Special thanks go to One Devonshire Gardens, LA Cakes, Leigh Garden Pilates and Boiler Room Fitness for the raffle prizes and also everyone who brought prizes of chocolate and booze on the night.</p>
