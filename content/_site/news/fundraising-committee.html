<p>Tuesday 4th September from 9pm, Cottiers Bar, Hyndland Street</p>

<p>The Parent Council’s Fundraising Committee organises several social events throughout the school year in order to get everyone together, make friends and collect funds to help the school.</p>

<p>The Fundraising Team currently  <strong>needs more volunteers</strong> to help with the events! If you would like to give us a hand and support the school at the same time, please contact <a href="mailto:marie.tate@ntlworld.com">Marie Tate</a>.</p>

<p>The team meets at 9pm at Cottiers on the first Tuesday of the month. Come along! Any help or input, big or small, is very welcome!</p>
