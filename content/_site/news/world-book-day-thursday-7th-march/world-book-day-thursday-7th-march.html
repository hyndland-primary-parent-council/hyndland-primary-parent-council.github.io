<p>Continuing the fun of Book Week, children are invited to come dressed as their favourite character from a book on World Book Day. Parents will also be invited along in the afternoon to visit the book fair to look at (and possibly purchase) books with their child.</p>

<p>Any parents, grandparents or friends of the family, authors, illustrators, story-tellers, poets etc. who would like to get involved with the celebrations on Thursday (tell us about your work, read a story, run a workshop with the children…) should contact Catherine MacQuarrie via the school office.</p>
