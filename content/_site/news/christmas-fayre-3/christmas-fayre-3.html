<p>Please support your enterprising children as they prepare for the annual Christmas Fayre. A letter from Miss Kelly (Acting Principal Teacher) came home this week detailing the kind of donations they’re looking for. Donations other than baking should be sent into class with your child. Home baking (REMEMBER – NO NUTS) can be brought to the glass doors side-entrance before 9am on the morning of the Fayre. All baking donations will be collected by P6 and P7 pupils. Remember they’re also looking for donations of goods, services, vouchers, tickets etc. which they can use for the silent auction. We look forward to seeing you in the afternoon of the fayre when we get the chance to see the wonderful stalls the children are running. Contact Miss Kelly if you need any further information.</p>
