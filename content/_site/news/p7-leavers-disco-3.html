<p>The P7s had their leavers disco on Thursday 22 June. Over 45 kids danced the night away to DJ Billy and his high energy tunes. A great time was had by all. At the end of the evening they were all presented with their leavers gifts, which included a T-shirt, yearbook and scientific calculator.</p>

<p>Thank you to the Parent Council for their contributions to the event, which included covering the cost of the DJ and the calculators.</p>
