<p>The new Autumn 2014 Scholastic Book Club leaflet will be in your child’s folder later this week. Scholastic Book Club magazines are sent out twice a year, in Sept and February, and raises funds for the school and class libraries. For every £1 you spend, 20p goes back to our school.</p>

<p>If you would like to order books from the leaflet and you want to pay by debit or credit card then order online at <a href="http://clubs-school.scholastic.co.uk/hyndland-primary" title="Scholastic Book Club">http://clubs-school.scholastic.co.uk/hyndland-primary</a></p>

<p>Alternatively you can order using the form on the back of the catalogue. Please note that if you are using the form you cannot pay with a credit or debit card. Please send your completed order form back to the school with the correct money, cash or cheque only. Change cannot be given (any money left over will go to the Parent Council). Cheques should be made payable to Scholastic Book Club.</p>

<p>Orders should be made by Thur 25 Sept (Sept weekend)</p>
