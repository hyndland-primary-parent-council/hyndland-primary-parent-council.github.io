<p>The playground project is coming along very well. Thank you to everyone who’s been bringing in their pennies. A huge thank you also to Mrs Ali who raised an extra £155 for us at her pakora and cupcake stall!! That brings the total so far to £433 with a final collection on the last day of school. The summer working bee will be one day in the first 2 weeks of August. Once we have all our volunteers we will decide the day which suits everyone best, preferably a week day so that we can access Afty facilities. To volunteer on the day or to donate materials please contact Sarah or Kate at <a href="mailto:sarah@icecreamarchitecture.com">sarah@icecreamarchitecture.com</a>.</p>
