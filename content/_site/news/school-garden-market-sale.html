<p>We will be holding the school garden market sale this  <strong>Friday 8 September in the school playground at pick up time</strong> to raise some funds for the school.</p>

<p>We’ll be selling produce from the garden and any baking donations (no nuts please!).</p>

<p>We are harvesting just now (mainly potatoes, apples and kale).</p>

<p>Any donations of baked goods or produce from allotments (for those who have one) would be much appreciated at the time of the sale.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
