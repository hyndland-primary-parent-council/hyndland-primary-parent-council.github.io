<h1 id="end-of-term-service--help-wanted">End of Term Service – help wanted</h1>

<p><a href="news/end-of-term-service-help-wanted/">June 12, 2013</a> <a href="author/admin/">admin</a></p>

<p>Tuesday 25th June, Hyndland Parish Church, Hyndland Road (opposite Top Tier)<br />
9.45-10.45</p>

<p>We need some help to deliver the Djembes (drums) to the church on the morning of the service and to return them to school. One people carrier or several smaller cars should be sufficient. They would be collected from school at 9am and unloaded at the church, giving you time to park before the service begins.</p>

<p>If you can help, please contact Fiona Kerr (Depute) or Jane Grove.</p>
