<p>Scholastic brochures have been distributed (extra copies available from the table outside the office). The  <strong>deadline for the latest Scholastic Book orders is Friday 7th February</strong>. This will be the last Scholastic order for this school year. Allison Mussett has taken over the running of our Scholastic orders from Yvonne Blair and reminds you:</p>

<p>Please pay by using cash or cheque – we don’t have the facility to take card payments. It is too complicated to give change, so any extra pennies will be donated to the school. Money raised from Scholastic goes towards books for classroom libraries for all ages.</p>

<p>Our thanks go to Yvonne Blair for her hard work organising previous Scholastic orders. Alison can be contacted at <a href="mailto:alison.mussett@btinternet.com">alison.mussett@btinternet.com</a></p>
