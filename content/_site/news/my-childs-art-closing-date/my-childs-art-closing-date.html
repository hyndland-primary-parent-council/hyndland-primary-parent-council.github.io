<p>The closing date for ordering Christmas cards, wrapping paper and gift products with your child’s Christmas artwork is  <strong>Thursday 5th December</strong> to ensure free delivery to school. After that you can still order but postage and packaging costs will be added. You’ll need the green slip with your child’s unique artwork code for access and all ordering is done online.</p>
