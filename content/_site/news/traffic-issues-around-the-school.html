<p><a href="news/traffic-issues-around-the-school/">September 5, 2016</a> <a href="author/admin/">admin</a></p>

<p>It has been brought to the attention of the Parent Council, both through contact by understandably concerned parents and through our own direct observation, that the traffic problems around the school continue almost unabated.</p>

<p>This has been taken up quite robustly with Glasgow City Council over the past two years and we are currently awaiting both the outcome of their Traffic Management Consultation for the area and a timeline for instituting road safety measures.</p>

<p>Below is the most recent communication from GCC dated 5 July 2016 in response to the Parent Council’s submission to this consultation. See also the two accompanying papers below.</p>

<p><strong>MESSAGE SENT ON BEHALF OF ANDY WADDELL</strong><br />
<strong>HEAD OF INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES</strong><br />
<strong>LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES</strong></p>

<p>Dear Mr Lewis</p>

<p><strong>THE GLASGOW CITY COUNCIL (PARTICK) (TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT AND PARKING CONTROLS) ORDER 201_</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for your correspondence regarding the above named Traffic Regulation Order.</p>

<p>I can advise that your support in regards to the implementation of School Keep Clear markings, one way operations and traffic calming measure on Fortrose Street is noted and will be considered and included within the final report which will inform the decision.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Council would not introduce parking schemes with designated parking spaces for any one individual / group or provide discounted parking permits for school staff. The Council must always take into account its wider aspirations and its strategic objectives whilst considering the needs of the area. We look to achieve this by creating accessible communities, encouraging economic growth by supporting local businesses and seeking sustainable options for travel.</p>

<p>I can further advise that once a decision has been taken in regards to these proposals I shall write to you again and advise of the outcome.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p><strong>Andy Waddell</strong><br />
<strong>Head of Infrastructure Services</strong><br />
<strong>Land and Environmental Services</strong></p>

<p>If you do drive to school, please be careful and considerate to pedestrians and other road users! The zig zag road markings outside the school gates indicate that you should not park or stop to drop off children. This allows children a clear view of oncoming traffic in both directions when crossing.</p>
