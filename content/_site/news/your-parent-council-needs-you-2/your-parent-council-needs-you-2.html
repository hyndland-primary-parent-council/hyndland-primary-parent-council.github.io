<p>Hyndland Primary School Parent Council is only as good as the support and involvement of those who contribute to it and the work of the wider Parent Forum. We are always looking for as wide a level of engagement with the Parent Council as possible, so please do approach Parent Council representatives with your comments, views and ideas and come along to the monthly meetings or email us at: <a href="mailto:enquiries@hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org">enquiries@hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org</a></p>

<p>The next meeting of the Parent Council is on Wednesday 24 February at 7pm in the staff room. We have someone from Glasgow City Council to come and give us an update on the 4Rs Building Project.</p>

<p>Please come along and support us!</p>
