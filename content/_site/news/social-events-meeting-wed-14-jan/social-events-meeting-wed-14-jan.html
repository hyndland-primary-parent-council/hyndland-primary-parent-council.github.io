<p><a href="news/social-events-meeting-wed-14-jan/">January 7, 2015</a> <a href="author/admin/">admin</a></p>

<p><strong>from 9pm, Cottiers Bar (Hyndland Road)</strong></p>

<p>If you have any comments about our fundraising social events (such as the Quiz Night or the Family Ceilidh) or if you have any ideas for future fundraising, why not come along to our Social events meeting.</p>

<p>Its really informal, and you won’t be roped into anything, just come along and have a chat about making more of the social activities at the school.</p>
