<p>A big thanks to those mums, dads, grannies, aunties, uncles and pals who took part in Five Go Running. A  <strong>HUGE</strong> thanks to those children from school who took part in fundraising runs. Brilliant effort all round!</p>

<p>As of 3 November, £593.73 has been raised through online and cash donations, all of which will go towards hiring coaches to take our children to use the excellent Commonwealth sports facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you to everyone who sponsored Mums on the Run.</strong></p>
