<p><a href="news/school-ceilidh-3/">June 29, 2017</a> <a href="author/admin/">admin</a></p>

<p>On Friday 2 June the Parent Council held our usual Spring Ceilidh (for the second time at Hyndland Community Hall), which was as ever a lot of fun for parents and children alike, and is also a great fundraiser for the school.</p>

<p>The event was organised by Nadia Miller who did a fantastic job preparing for it and also on the night. Thanks also to Alan Bonnyman and Graham and Ashley MacFarlane, along with Nadia, for sourcing raffle prizes. <em>Thanks very much folks!</em></p>

<p>Special thanks should also go to the following people for helping out on the night through – variously – obtaining additional raffle prizes, selling raffle and tombola tickets, taking admission fees, setting up the good, setting up and clearing up, etc.</p>

<p>Further special thanks are also due to the following people and/or businesses who generously donated raffle prizes: Amber and Black, Conor from Cafe Source Too, Hely Hair Studio, David and Cathy Kinnear at Hyndland Bookshop, Hyndland Fox, Ikea, James Allan Butcher, Pampas, Roscoe’s Deli, Sainsbury’s Novar Drive, Soulspace, Station Flowers, and The Yellow Shop; and also to Jamie Smith and his ceilidh band for their excellent performance (and for Jamie kindly waiving his own share of the band fee).</p>

<p>On the night we took £633.20, of which £250.20 was profit after the hall hire, band costs and food and soft drinks were taken into account. This is an excellent contribution to the work the Parent Council does to support the school.</p>

<p>Thank you to all of you who were involved in any way!</p>
