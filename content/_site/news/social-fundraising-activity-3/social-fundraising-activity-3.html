<p>We are constantly in need of more parents to volunteer their help with the planning and running of Parent Council fundraising events. Much of this work goes into organising and running the ceilidhs, parent quiz nights and other fundraising event that raise the money which benefits the education of all of our children.</p>

<p><strong>We really do need more volunteers!</strong></p>

<p>If you think you could offer any help or ideas with social activities which will help raise funds for the school, please come along to any Parent Council meeting, or contact Alan Bonnyman (Treasurer) at abonnyman23@hotmail.com or John Lewis at john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk.</p>

<p>All funds raised get ploughed into school resources to enrich the learning and recreational experience for our children.</p>
