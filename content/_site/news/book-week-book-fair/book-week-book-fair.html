<p>As part of the school’s celebration of Book Week, the Travelling Book Company will be here at the school for pupils from Wednesday 6th March until Monday 11th March.</p>

<p>School will organise class rotas for visits to enable children to buy books but we’re looking for parent volunteers to staff the books. We are therefore looking for anyone who would be willing to go on a rota system for the books between 6th and 11th March around 9am – 12 noon and 1.30 – 3pm.</p>

<p><strong>If you can help, please send in a note with times that you are available, we can then draw up a rota. Even if you can only manage 1 hour, that would be helpful.</strong></p>

<p>Catherine Harte, Depute.</p>
