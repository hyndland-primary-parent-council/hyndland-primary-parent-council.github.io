<p>Unfortunately, it was not possible to reschedule the cancelled Parent Council meeting last week, and as it’s the AGM and we usually get quite a few more parents along, it wasn’t possible to move to another venue at such short notice.</p>

<p>Due to other commitments, it will not be possible to rearrange the meeting before the next scheduled Parent Council meeting. As such, the AGM will not take place on  <strong>Wednesday 11 October</strong> , at 7pm in the School Dining Hall.</p>
