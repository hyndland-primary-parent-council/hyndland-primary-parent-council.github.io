<p>The annual playground spring clean will take place on <strong>Sunday May 31st from 10am to 2pm</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone is welcome including children and wider family members, the more the merrier!</strong></p>

<p>The types of chores you might be doing include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>painting the boards on the bin shelter with chalkboard paint</li>
  <li>painting the mushrooms in the open air classroom area</li>
  <li>sowing some wildflower seeds</li>
  <li>fixing the outdoor chimes in the P1 playground (by using old metal cooking utensils – donations welcome!)</li>
  <li>help running a second hand uniform sale (sorting and washing clothes)</li>
  <li>cleaning the bike shelter</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What do you need to bring?</strong></p>

<p>Brooms, bin bags, gardening equipment (we have lots of child size things but need adult sized spades and forks), paint brushes and any spare paint (outdoor).</p>

<p>Donations of homebaking to keep all the volunteers going would be great!</p>

<p><strong>CAN’T MAKE THE 31ST BUT STILL WANT TO HELP OUT?</strong></p>

<p>If you cannot help out on the 31st there are general chores which can be done in the garden at any time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Digging over the raised beds in the school and afty garden</li>
  <li>Giving the worms in the wormery some food</li>
  <li>General tidying and sweeping up in the garden</li>
  <li>Sowing sunflower seeds</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are free at school pick up, please take your children into the garden – we have plenty of “child size” gardening tools and gardening gloves. There are also waterproofs and wellies in the outdoor learning area in the glass foyer of the school – please feel free to use.</p>

<p>Helen would be happy to show people around the garden and let them know where everything is. She can do this at school drop off (Mon-Fri) or school collection (Mon, Tues, Thurs).</p>
