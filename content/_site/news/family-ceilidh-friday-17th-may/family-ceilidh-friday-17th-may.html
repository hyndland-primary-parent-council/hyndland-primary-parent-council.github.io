<p>7-10pm, Partick Burgh Halls</p>

<p>Adults £4, Children £2</p>

<p>Along with many of you, we’re looking forward to the family ceilidh on Friday.  <strong>Tickets are now available from Jane in the playground or via the Parent Council box by the office if you send in your request and payment.</strong> They’re selling fast so get yours soon.</p>

<p>On the night we’ll be looking for  <strong>donations to the buffet</strong> (which… let’s be honest… is usually polished off by the children, so we recommend that adults grab a snack before coming out!). This year, new food preparation regulations at the Burgh Halls mean that all food should be cold or pre-cooked. There will be no facility for heating food. Contributions can be savoury or sweet and anything suitable for children’s party food is along the right lines.  <strong>Please remember, NO NUTS.</strong></p>

<p>We’re also looking for  <strong>raffle prizes</strong> – most of these are child orientated, but if you have something for grown-ups, that would also be welcome.</p>

<p>There will be dancing, chat, food and fun. You don’t have to dance, but if the mood takes you… go with it! Younger siblings are also welcome. Please make sure buggies are not blocking the dance floor or aisles. If not needed for sleeping babies, you can park them near the entrance. We’ll let you know where.</p>

<p>There will be various ways you can help on the night by  <strong>volunteering</strong> to lay food out, “police the plates” to make sure food is shared fairly, sell raffle tickets or help with the cleanup. We are keen recyclers so will collect bottles, cans etc. from the evening to uphold our green flag status.  <strong>Let Jane know when you arrive if you can lend a hand.</strong></p>

<p>Please remember tickets are restricted to three children per adult and NO UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN will be allowed in.</p>
