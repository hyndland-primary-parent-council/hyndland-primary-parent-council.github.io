Nonetheless their focus will necessarily have shifted to the High School by the end of summer and the garden will need new volunteers to care for it. Susan’s oft repeated claim is that it is the best allotment in the West End and she is looking someone, or a small group, who would be interested in taking over the care of the garden.  If you can help out it will be much appreciated by all. Please text Susan on 07882 942945 or email at <a href="mailto:matboffice@yahoo.co.uk">matboffice@yahoo.co.uk</a> . Further, if you can help with watering the plants over the summer holidays do please get in touch.</p>
