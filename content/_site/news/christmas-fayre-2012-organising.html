<p>Come along and find out about the biggest fundraising event of the calendar.</p>

<p>Last year the Christmas Fayre raised over £3300, which went towards playground improvements, fixing smartboards and many other things that benefit all the pupils at Hyndland Primary School.</p>

<p>Lots of people get involved in what is a great day.</p>

<p>We are looking for parents/carers who might be able to help organise the event, from sending out emails, or asking shops for gifts to sell, to helping out on the day.</p>

<p>Please come along to find out more, or if you have any new ideas for stalls.</p>

<p>If you are interested in helping out, but can’t come along to the meeting, please <a href="mailto:alison.mussett@btinternet.com">email</a> Alison Mussett.</p>

<p>Christmas Fayre will be on Fri 7 Dec.</p>
