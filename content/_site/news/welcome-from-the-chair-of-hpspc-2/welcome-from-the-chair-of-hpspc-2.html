<p><a href="news/welcome-from-the-chair-of-hpspc-2/">August 23, 2017</a> <a href="author/admin/">admin</a></p>

<p>Welcome back to the start of a new school year, and for those of you who are new to the school, welcome to Hyndland Primary School.</p>

<p>After yet another typical Glasgow summer of fluctuating weather, another year of great learning and development for our children has just got underway.</p>

<p>Also, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank Susan Taylor, Helen Rolph and all of the parent and pupil helpers for the gardening and playground improvement work over the summer. Well done!</p>

<p>We have finally got the first part of the implementation of the new traffic management and parking system in place in both the Fortrose Street and White Street/Gardner Street approaches to the school, which is certainly appearing to ease many of the traffic problems on Fortrose Street at least. There are some continuing issues, however, so please see the brief article below on the issue.</p>

<p>Mr Stephen Frame, the new Depute Head is now getting his feet under the table at the school, so a warm welcome again to him. Mr Frame will have responsibilities for the infants, while Mr Byrne will retain responsibility for the upper school. Also, congratulations to Mrs Julie Wynn on continuing her role as Acting Principal Teacher this year.</p>

<p>The first Parent Council social event is in the diary and that is for the  <strong>Parent Council Pub Quiz, which is booked at Partick Bowling Club on Friday 29 September 2017</strong> (adults only); more details to follow shortly.</p>

<p>Finally, for parents who have been with the school for some time, as well as those of you who are new, the work of the Parent Council, along with that of all of the parents who contribute to its activities, is a collective effort and we all have a vested interest in the fortunes of the school and in the positive experience of our children and the staff during our time at and with the school. So, we on the Parent Council look forward to working with the school and, most importantly, all of you as parents to ensure that Hyndland Primary School continues to provide a happy, healthy, enjoyable and appropriately challenging educational experience for all of our young people.</p>

<p>Involvement with the Parent Council, either as a Rep or attending meetings and other activities as a parent really is a great chance to find out what’s going on in the school. So, please do become involved and, should you wish to discuss any issues please either get in touch with the Parent Rep for your child or children’s school year (or, indeed, any of the Parent Reps), or contact me at <a href="mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk">john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk.</a></p>

<p>The first meeting of the year for the <strong>Parent Council is the Annual General Meeting on Wednesday 13 September (7pm-9pm)</strong>. We hope to see as many of you as possible there and also in subsequent meetings.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Parent Council I wish all of the children and staff at our school a successful and fun year, and hope that we will all enjoy the experience along with our children.</p>

<p>Best wishes,</p>

<p><strong>John Lewis<br />
Chair, Hyndland Primary School Parent Council</strong></p>
