<h3 id="what-happens-at-the-christmas-fayre">What happens at the Christmas Fayre?</h3>

<p>The Christmas Fayre is on Fri 7 December this year and runs for the full school day.</p>

<p>In the morning the children come down a class at a time with their teacher and spend some time going round the stalls buying cakes, toys/books. From 1.30pm – 3.15pm parents and carers are invited to come along. You can pick up your children early from their class to go round the fayre with you if you want. A café runs in the dining hall in the afternoon selling tea, coffee, juice and cakes.</p>

<p>The money we raise makes a huge difference to the school. Last year the Fayre raised over £3,200 and over the year we raised around £7,000 in total. This helped fund playground improvements and teaching resources.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s how you can help:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Come along!</li>
  <li>Make a donation</li>
  <li>Volunteer to help out on the day</li>
</ul>

<p>See below for a stall by stall guide to the type of donations you might want to make and for details of where to drop them off.</p>

<p>If you are interested  <strong>in volunteering</strong>  to help out on the day contact Linda McCormick <a href="mailto:lindamccormick1@googlemail.com">lindamccormick1@googlemail.com</a></p>
