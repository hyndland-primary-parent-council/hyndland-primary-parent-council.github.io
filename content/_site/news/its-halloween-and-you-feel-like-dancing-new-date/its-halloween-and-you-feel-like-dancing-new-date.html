<p>NB: The date of this event has been changed from 2 November to 26 October due to availability of Parent Council volunteers. There is no bar at the Hyndland Community Halls, so it is Bring Your Own Bottle (BYOB). There is a Sainsbury’s Local next door to the venue. Soft drinks will be provided for children and alcohol-free adults.</p>
