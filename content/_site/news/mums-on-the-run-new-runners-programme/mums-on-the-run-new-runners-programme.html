<p>Calling all Hyndland Primary mums! Ever wanted to run but just don’t know how to start? Fancy running but don’t want to do it on your own? Do you just fancy being a wee bit fitter? If the answer to any of those questions is yes, then come along and join Hyndland Mums on the Run. We’re having a meeting on Thursday May 8th at 9am, just after drop off, in school. At the meeting you can meet and chat with some of our newer and more experienced runners and see if running with the group is for you.</p>

<p>We run every Thursday morning, are a friendly bunch and usually finish our runs with a coffee. On May 15 we’re starting a new programme which is ideal for beginners – and by beginners we mean those of you who think you can’t run, but you could walk for half an hour. We’d also love to see you if you’re a more experienced runner as we have ladies training for 5ks, 10ks and half marathons.</p>

<p>Contact Louise at <a href="mailto:hyndlandmumsontherun@gmail.com">hyndlandmumsontherun@gmail.com</a> for more information or just come along to the meeting on the 8th. Don’t wait until you get fit to start running, just get started.</p>
