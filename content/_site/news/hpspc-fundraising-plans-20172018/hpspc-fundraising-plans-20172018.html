<p>Firstly, a huge thank you to everyone who has helped out with fundraising in any way over the last year, we couldn’t have done it without everyone’s help: buying tickets, donating raffle prizes, giving your time to organise and help at events has been hugely beneficial to the learning experience of all our children. The parent council funds raised paid for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>P1 music lessons</li>
  <li>School Garden supplies</li>
  <li>Christmas books</li>
  <li>Buddy hats</li>
  <li>P7 leaving party and gifts</li>
  <li>Office and janitorial staff Xmas gifts</li>
</ul>

<p>This year, on top of these costs, the parent council would like to focus our fundraising efforts on developing and improving the outdoor learning experience at the school, which, along with the school’s senior management team, we have decided should be a priority now that the school building renovations are finally complete!</p>

<p>The parent council have booked in our main fundraising events early so that we can all plan them in and raise even more than ever for your school:</p>

<p>To ensure we make these events profitable and fun for all, we need your help: A fundraising task force will be meeting once a term to come up with ideas and share organisational tasks. We would love to see you there to help in any way you can! Be it offering your time, skills, or donating from your business to raffles etc.</p>

<p>First meet-up will be at West of Scotland Cricket Club on Peel Street on Tues 19th Sept at 7pm. If you can attend this please contact me on 07792226959 or nadiamiller085@gmail.com. Don’t worry if this doesn’t suit, give me a shout if you have an idea and can’t make it along and we can raise it at the meeting.</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance, Nadia Miller (Lyra &amp; Alva’s mum)</p>
