<p>We have a new way to fundraise to help the school which doesn’t require any extra expenditure. As well as enjoying shopping locally, many of us will choose from time to time to order online. This is a really easy way to see that the school benefits from something you do anyway.</p>

<p>It’s really simple – just shop online via <a href="http://easyfundraising.org.uk/">http://easyfundraising.org.uk/</a> with over 2,700 well known retailers like Amazon, Argos, M&amp;S, eBay (and many more!) and whenever you buy something online, the retailer makes a donation to your chosen good cause.</p>

<p>It doesn’t cost you a single penny extra.</p>

<p>You can sign up to raise for  <strong>Hyndland Primary School Parent Council – Glasgow</strong> too.</p>

<p>Over £5,000,000 has been raised for good causes around the UK so far, so it really does work!</p>

<p>Get started now <a href="http://t.ymlp339.net/ewmalauesyqacaushavaewm/click.php">http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/invite/2BLQGE/</a></p>

<p>By using this special invitation link you’ll be registered as an invited friend and if you eventually raise £10 then an extra £5 is added by easyfundraising. So if you could use the link it might raise a bit more!</p>

<p>With Christmas coming up, please spread the word among your friends and family. They can use the link too.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Alan, Dorothy and Linda for their research and setting up.</p>
