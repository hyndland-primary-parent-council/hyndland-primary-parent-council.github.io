<p>Unfortunately, it was not possible to reschedule the cancelled Parent Council meeting last week, and as it’s the AGM and we usually get quite a few more parents along, it wasn’t possible to move to another venue at such short notice. Due to other commitments, it will not be possible to rearrange the meeting before […]</p>

<p>We will be holding the school garden market sale this Friday 8 September in the school playground at pick up time to raise some funds for the school. We’ll be selling produce from the garden and any baking donations (no nuts please!). We are harvesting just now (mainly potatoes, apples and kale). Any donations of baked […]</p>

<p>Firstly, a huge thank you to everyone who has helped out with fundraising in any way over the last year, we couldn’t have done it without everyone’s help: buying tickets, donating raffle prizes, giving your time to organise and help at events has been hugely beneficial to the learning experience of all our children.
