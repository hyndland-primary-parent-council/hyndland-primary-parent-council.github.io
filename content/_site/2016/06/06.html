<h1 id="janny-joes-retirement"><a href="news/janny-joes-retirement/">Janny Joe’s Retirement</a></h1>

<p>Janny Joe retires from the school on Friday 12 August, just before the school starts back. Ms Brown will let parents and carers know of any farewell arrangements. A collection for a farewell gift for Joe from parents will take place over the summer, with the collection tin available until Thursday 11 August in the […]</p>

<p>Naheed, Andrew and the rest of the Music Club staff continue to do a fantastic job supporting pupils at the school to engage with a range of musical instruments, from the penny whistle to the fiddle, the double bass to the djembes, the guitar to the human voice. As well as providing opportunities for the […]</p>

<p>As the holidays approach we usually put together a watering rota for the school garden. If you are free to take your children down to the garden on a particular week over the summer to water the plants, please contact Helen at hjrolph@gmail.com as this will be a great help. There are plenty of activities […]</p>

<h1 id="school-ceilidh"><a href="news/school-ceilidh-2/">School Ceilidh</a></h1>

<p>On Friday 20 May the Parent Council held our usual Spring Ceilidh, which – some obnoxious behaviour to parents and children from one of the Burgh Halls staff aside – was as ever a lot of fun for parents and children alike, and is also a great fundraiser for the school. The event was organised […]</p>

<h1 id="mums-on-the-run-motr"><a href="news/mums-on-the-run-motr/">Mums on the Run (MOTR)</a></h1>

<p>Since we started in 2013 our aim has been to provide a supportive network of running buddies to mum who want to start or improve their running, and we have a trained JogScotland leader who can provide help and advice. We’ve raised over £2,500 for school projects, including this year’s trips to the Emirates Stadium, […]</p>

<h1 id="pennies-for-playground-fundraiser-update"><a href="news/pennies-for-playground-fundraiser-update/">Pennies for Playground Fundraiser Update</a></h1>

<p>The playground project is coming along very well. Thank you to everyone who’s been bringing in their pennies. A huge thank you also to Mrs Ali who raised an extra £155 for us at her pakora and cupcake stall!! That brings the total so far to £433 with a final collection on the last day […]</p>

<h1 id="your-parent-council-needs-you"><a href="news/your-parent-council-needs-you-3/">Your Parent Council needs you</a></h1>

<p>Hyndland Primary School Parent Council is only as good as the support and involvement of those who contribute to it and the work of the wider Parent Forum. We are always looking for as wide a level of engagement between the Parent Council and wider Parent Forum as possible, whether that be funding ideas, ideas […]</p>

<h1 id="parent-council-fundraising--and-what-we-spend-it-on"><a href="news/parent-council-fundraising-and-what-we-spend-it-on/">Parent Council Fundraising – and what we spend it on</a></h1>

<p>This year the Parent Council has been – as always – finding ways to actively raise funds in order to support the school, by purchasing a range of resources to help enrich the children’s learning experiences. Over the 2015-16 school year you have helped us raise at least £1761.27. This is slightly less than last […]</p>

<h1 id="from-the-chair"><a href="news/from-the-chair/">From the Chair</a></h1>

<p>The End is Nigh! Well, the summer holidays are almost upon us! It has been another great year of learning and teaching and productive activity and development for the children at Hyndland Primary School. They have experienced an engaging curriculum in line with the aims, principles and the four capacities of Curriculum for Excellence – […]</p>

<h1 id="pennies-for-playgrounds"><a href="news/pennies-for-playgrounds/">Pennies for Playgrounds</a></h1>

<p>There is still time to dig out your coppers and give them to the Pennies for Playgrounds project! Finally there is something useful to do with those annoying copper pennies that sit in the bottom of drawers or underneath the sofa. The aim is to create some innovative low cost changes to the middle playground […]</p>
