<p>The ceilidh was another great success with parents and children alike enjoying another excellent evening of dancing, chatting and fun.</p>

<p>We managed to raise £570.30, which was less than usual and just about managed to cover the costs. The reason for the dip is because there were slightly fewer parents and children attending, we took a different approach to the raffle and there were fewer raffle prizes.</p>

<p>However, the main purpose of this event is for parents to enjoy some social time together and for the children to meet out of school and have a late night!</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for coming, and particularly everyone who brought food for the huge buffet and raffle prizes, Grant and the band for the music, and a special mention to Gwen, Emma and Marie for helping out on the door, with the raffle and cleaning up.</p>
