<p>As most parents will be well aware, traffic problems continue to occur around the school, with cars coming in both directions on Fortrose Street; gridlock; pavement mounting going forwards and backwards, and not always looking out for pedestrians – including small children – when they do; parking on the yellow zig zag no parking zone […]</p>

<p>On Friday 11 December our indefatigable MOTR undertook an LP run, which, in the style of an LP (for those of us old enough to know what they are!) ran around the cricket pitch for 33 1/3 minutes and then went into a bake-off. MOTR raised £86.00 from the run and Bake Off and this […]</p>

<p>On Friday 20 November, the Parent Council held our usual autumn Ceilidh, which was as ever a lot of fun for parents and children alike and is a great fundraiser for the school.

<p>Just a wee reminder that the school Christmas Fayre is on tomorrow – Thursday 17 December – in the morning for the children and also from 1.30pm to 3pm for parents, carers and family. The school has asked the Parent Council to request that children carry no more than £5 to school to spend at […]</p>
