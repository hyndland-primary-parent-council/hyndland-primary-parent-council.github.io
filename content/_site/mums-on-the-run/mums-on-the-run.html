<h1 id="mums-on-the-run">Mums on the Run</h1>

<p>Hyndland Mums on the Run began in September 2013 when twelve Hyndland mums decided to get together and run a sponsored 5k race to raise money for sports and outdoor equipment for the school. We now have many runners (from beginners to half marathon racers), a qualified running coach and are affiliated to Jog Scotland. Our aim is to get Hyndland mums running and to feel all the benefits that running in a sociable group can bring: support, camaraderie, fitness and the happiness that only a post-run coffee and cake can bring.</p>

<p>We currently meet at 7pm every Wednesday evening. If you’re interested in joining us, contact Louise at <a href="mailto:hyndlandmotr@gmail.com">hyndlandmotr@gmail.com</a>.  <strong>Because of coronavirus restrictions, you <em>must</em> contact us before joining a run</strong>.</p>

<p>Don’t wait to get fit to join – join us and get fit.</p>
