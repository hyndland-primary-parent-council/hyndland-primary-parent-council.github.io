<h1 id="scholastic-book-club">Scholastic Book Club</h1>

<p>As a way of raising funds for the school library and for our classrooms, the Parent Council have set up an account with Scholastic Book Clubs.</p>

<p>Scholastic Book Clubs are an easy way for you and your child to choose and buy suitable books to read at home. The leaflets feature a wide range of books to suit everyone. You will also see that most books are half-price or less!</p>

<p>And with every order placed, the school earns free books. For every £1 you spend, 20p goes back to our school to spend on much-needed books for our library. Last year, the school raised over £400 in free books!</p>

<p>Several times a year, a Scholastic Book Clubs leaflet will be sent home in your child’s homework folder. We hope that you and your child will enjoy browsing through the leaflet – it is a great way to encourage your child to widen their reading experience.</p>

<p>If you would like to order books from the leaflet, the preferred, most easy and secure way is to order online at <a href="http://clubs-school.scholastic.co.uk/hyndland-primary" title="Hyndland Scholastic Link">http://clubs-school.scholastic.co.uk/hyndland-primary</a></p>

<p>If placing your order online is not possible, you can:</p>

<ol>
  <li> fill in the order form at the back of the catalogue</li>
  <li>put the order in an envelope with the correct money, cash or cheque* only (NO credit or debit card numbers please!)</li>
  <li>seal the envelope and write ‘Scholastic Order’ along with your child’s name and class</li>
  <li>return the envelope to the school in your child’s folder, or to the office</li>
</ol>

<p><em>* If paying by cheque, please make payable to Scholastic Book Club</em></p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: home delivery or credit card orders MUST be made online, by phone, or mailed in directly to Scholastic by the parent/guardian.</p>

<p>All order must be received online or in school by the date stated on the back of the leaflet.</p>

<p>The books that you order will arrive at the school, to be distributed in class.</p>
