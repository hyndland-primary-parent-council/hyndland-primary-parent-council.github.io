# School Ceilidh

[May 26, 2015](past-events/school-ceilidh/) [admin](author/admin/)

The ceilidh was another great success with parents and children alike enjoying another excellent evening of dancing, chatting and fun.

We managed to raise Â£570.30, which was less than usual and just about managed to cover the costs. The reason for the dip is because there were slightly fewer parents and children attending, we took a different approach to the raffle and there were fewer raffle prizes.

However, the main purpose of this event is for parents to enjoy some social time together and for the children to meet out of school and have a late night!

Thanks to everyone for coming, and particularly everyone who brought food for the huge buffet and raffle prizes, Grant and the band for the music, and a special mention to Gwen, Emma and Marie for helping out on the door, with the raffle and cleaning up.
