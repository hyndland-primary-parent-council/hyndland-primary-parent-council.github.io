# Hyndland Primary Parent Council

### Parent Noticeboard

# [Parent Council Annual General Meeting Re-Schedule](news/parent-council-annual-general-meeting-re-schedule/)

Unfortunately, it was not possible to reschedule the cancelled Parent Council meeting last week, and as it’s the AGM and we usually get quite a few more parents along, it wasn’t possible to move to another venue at such short notice. Due to other commitments, it will not be possible to rearrange the meeting before […]

# [Parent Council AGM – POSTPONED](news/parent-council-agm-postponed/)

Firstly, a huge thank you to everyone who has helped out with fundraising in any way over the last year, we couldn’t have done it without everyone’s help: buying tickets, donating raffle prizes, giving your time to organise and help at events has been hugely beneficial to the learning experience of all our children.
