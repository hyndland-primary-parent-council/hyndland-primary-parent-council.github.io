The Parent Council represents parents’ and carers’ views and wishes to the school and to the City Council. It also acts in pupils’ interests in a range of other ways, for example, by helping improve the playground, by raising money to purchase new equipment, update libraries, provide leavers’ packs, and by hosting events such as the Halloween party and the Burns Ceilidh.

You can get involved with the Parent Council by coming along to our AGM or regular meetings or by joining or helping one of our sub-committees – there are currently two: the Playground committee and the Fundraising committee. You can also support all the great things the Parent Council does for the school and its pupils by attending one of our events, doing your online shopping through the [easyfundraising](https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/hyndlandprimary/) site, or making a direct donation to our PayPal account.

The Parent Council’s main aims are to:

- Work in partnership with the school to create a welcoming spirit which is inclusive of the whole school community
- Identify and represent the views of parents/carers on the education provided by the school and other matters affecting pupils’ education and welfare
- Promote parental involvement in their child’s education and learning
- Develop and engage in activities which support pupils’ education and welfare

All parents and carers of pupils at the school are automatically members of the Parent Forum; being a member entitles you to have a say in what happens at the school. The Parent Council was set up by parents/carers of Hyndland Primary School to represent the views of the Parent Forum. There are currently 8 parent members, 2 staff members and 2 co-opted members. Please refer to the Contact Us page for further details.

Each year (P1, P2, P3, etc) has a year group rep who is a member of the Parent Council. These reps help disseminate information to parents of children in the relevant year and also take general issues raised by parents back to the school, whether at class teacher or head teacher level.

Please&nbsp;[contact](../contact-us) your child’s year group Rep or the Parent Council Secretary if you would like the Parent Council to raise an issue with the school.&nbsp;However, please note that matters concerning individual children should be referred directly to your child’s class teacher or to the [Head Teacher](mailto:headteacher@hyndland-pri.glasgow.sch.uk).

As well as the parent reps, the Parent Council has representatives from the school and two co-opted members representing wider interests.

The two sub-committees also give parents and carers a way to be involved in making improvements at Hyndland Primary:

**Fundraising** : Organises fund-raising events, sponsored runs, quiz nights, ceilidhs etc.
**Playground** : Helps plan and implement improvements in the school’s playgrounds.

Please [email](mailto:hello@hyndlandprimary.parent-council.scot) for more information on how to get involved.

Parent Council meetings are usually held once a month on a Wednesday at 7.00pm in the school staff room, however, because of the coronavirus pandemic they will be held on Zoom or an equivalent online platform for the foreseeable future.
