Hyndland Primary Parent Council is raising desperately needed funds for the Red Cross to support the emergency in Ukraine. To support this unfolding crisis Hyndland Primary Parent Council thought why not spring into action with a walking challenge (cyclists included) to reach our twin city Marseille.

Our Mission: Walk, run, skip, jump, cycle or hop our way to Marseille.

Distance: 1,200 Miles (give or take a detour)

Goal: £500 to be donated to the Red Cross.

From the 14th March until the 30th March we are asking as many of you as possible to get involved and start recording your walks, skips, cycles, hops, and jumps so that collectively we can make it all the way to Marseille. Please let us know how many miles you have completed by filling in the form below. You can fill this in as many times as you would like, don’t forget to keep us updated regulary and we will update our map below so you can follow along with our journey. Here is a good calculator for converting your steps to miles for those of you with a fitbit. [Steps to Miles](https://www.omnicalculator.com/sports/steps-to-miles).

We kindly ask that all sponsorship money be collected by parents and paid via [ParentPay](https://www.parentpay.com/) this will allow the children to see how much has been raised and will be directly donated to the Red Cross. We are aware that times are challenging just now so please only donate what you can afford, it will all add up and together we can reach our goal of £500.

If you would like to talk to your child further about the Red Cross and its efforts to reach people in need, you can find out more from their website [here](https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/ukraine-crisis-appeal?c_code=175151&c_source=google&c_name=Ukraine%20Crisis%20Appeal&adg=pure%20brand&c_creative=brand&c_medium=cpc&gclid=Cj0KCQiA95aRBhCsARIsAC2xvfzgDya0PSymbgiwou805dVuwW-21wUzWuY7bJ9PiYmQ1oHROJRfFeEaAsAHEALw_wcB).

As of 22nd March, we have walked 250 miles and reached the town of Doncaster. Can we make it another 950??
