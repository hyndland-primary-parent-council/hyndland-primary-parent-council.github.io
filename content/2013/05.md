# [Thanks for dedicated service](/news/thanks-for-dedicated-service/)

At the end of term we will sadly be losing not only our Head Teacher, Ms Laville, as she retires&nbsp;but also three long-standing members of staff who have&nbsp;dedicated many years service to the children of Hyndland Primary.&nbsp; Mrs Linda Francis and Miss Fiona Miller (both with over 20 years service to the infant department) will […]
