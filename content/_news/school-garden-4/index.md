At Hyndland Primary we are keen to promote outdoor learning. The school garden and parts of the playgrounds are currently maintained by green fingered parents Susan Taylor and Helen Rolph, but they need your help. Would you be able to volunteer some of your time? They are always looking for volunteers to help out not just in the school garden, but with the plants dotted around the playgrounds too. You could water the gardens and pots, help with planting, digging and preparing plants and seeds for classes.

Susan and Helen will be looking for parent volunteers to help them with the gardening projects, so whether or not you are good with a trowel or can tell the difference between a plant and a weed, all-comers are welcome. If you are interested, please contact Susan Taylor on 07882 942945 or Helen Rolph at [hjrolph@gmail.com](mailto:hjrolph@gmail.com).
