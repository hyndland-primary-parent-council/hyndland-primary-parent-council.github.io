Congratulations to the winners who just pipped their “Toronto” rivals in a tense, hilarious and frankly ridiculous dance-off-tie-breaker. Thanks to Phil for creating such a brilliant quiz, Grant for helping with the marking, and Linda, Anne and Vivienne for running the show. £406 was raised and will go towards our playground improvement plans. If you didn’t make it this time, we hope to see you in March.
