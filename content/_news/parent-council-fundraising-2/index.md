This year the Parent Council has been – as always – finding ways to actively raise funds in order to support the school, by purchasing a range of resources to help enrich the children’s learning experiences. Over the 2014-15 school year you have all helped us raise almost £2,000, with £10,000 being spent this year on a whole range of important resources: including funding built up over the last few years to pay for ‘big ticket’ items, such as the wonderful new Outdoor Classroom installed in the top playground this week, outdoor sports equipment, plants and gardening equipment, buddy caps, skipping ropes, Christmas books for the children, dictionary gifts for P7 leavers, contributions to P7 leavers’ party, etc.

&nbsp;

Additionally, parents throughout the school have contributed to raising funds through a variety of activities, such as taking part in or sponsoring Mums on the Run (see below), baking, cooking, making, creating, donating to or buying from the School Christmas Fayre and the Farmers’ Market, Quiz Night and Ceilidh Nights (door receipts and raffle tickets), sourcing resources at a discount, linking your online shopping activity to [www.easyfundraising.org.uk](http://www.easyfundraising.org.uk), buying books through the school book fairs, buying the school Scots poetry/song CD, DVD of the Christmas Play, etc.

Thank you all for your kind and generous support. The Parent Council and the school will continue to seek such support through ongoing activities. If you have any ideas for raising funds please [contact us](contact-us/).
