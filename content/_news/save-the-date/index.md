**The next family ceilidh is on Friday 9 December**

The Ceilidh is Hyndland Primary Parent Council’s most popular social event – it’s a great evening for all the family with music, dancing, buffet, kids’ tombola and an adult raffle. The money raised will go towards a range of needed school resources, such as buddy hats, homework folders, sports equipment, dictionaries or calculators that are given to P7s when they leave in the summer, etc. We’ll be looking for volunteers to help on the night, for raffle and tombola gifts and for food for the buffet. Put the date in the diary; it’s sure to be a night to remember!

You can buy tickets on the door, only £4 for adults and £2 for children. A maximum of 3 children per adult. No unaccompanied children will be allowed in.

We have changed the venue from that which we used over the past few years, as we had become unhappy at some rude and inappropriate behaviour from a member of staff at the previous venue. This time it will be held at Hyndland Community Hall on Novar Drive, near the Novar Drive nursery and Lauderdale Play Park. It is a short walk from Hyndland Train Station and close to buses that serve Clarence Drive and Hyndland Road, so is still very accessible.

The change in venue will allow us to retain more income to use on school resources, as the venue represents a substantial saving on the cost of renting the Burgh Halls.

There is no bar at the Community Hall and alcohol cannot be sold, so it is BYOB, which is allowed. Soft drinks will be provided free for children and hopefully there will also be enough to cater for parents/carers/teachers who are non-drinkers or designated drivers.

We will have to completely clean up immediately after the event, ready for the Hall’s use the following morning, so we will also be looking for volunteers who can help do this. Please contact us at [enquiries@hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org](mailto:enquiries@hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org).
