### WE DID IT!!!

A fabulous effort by all the Mums on the Run at the Glasgow Women’s 10k on Sunday 11 May. Above…most of the cheery team pleased to have made it to the finish. &nbsp;Some of us are so keen we’ve already entered the Great Scottish Run which takes place in October. Want to join us? &nbsp;Contact our fabulous JogScotland coach, Louise Love at&nbsp;[hyndlandmumsontherun@gmail.com](mailto:hyndlandmumsontherun@gmail.com)

You can see more of the Hyndland Mums on the Run in action on the&nbsp;[Evening Times website](http://t.ymlp211.net/eyyaxaujweharauwbavaewm/click.php)&nbsp;and on the&nbsp;[Daily Record website](http://t.ymlp211.net/mssaaaujwehanauwbapaewm/click.php).

Thanks to everyone who supported us by sponsoring Jane. &nbsp;Your pledges and words of encouragement have meant a great deal and spurred Jane on to her PB of 1hour10mins2secs, and have raised well over her £500 target for the school!

It’s still not too late to make a pledge if you want to. Just click on the link to make your pledge. Thanks!
