Sam Murray is our new parent volunteer Uniform Coordinator. Sam will be coordinating the next order for uniform which will be placed at the end of August. If you need to put in an order you can download the order form from the [School Uniform](http://www.hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org/school-uniform/ "School Uniform") page of the website or collect a form from the school office.

Make sure you include the correct money or cheque along with your child’s name and class marked clearly on the form and the envelope and place it in the Parent Council box next to the school office.

The next order after that will be at the end of October so don’t miss the 30th August deadline!

Our thanks go to Audur Gudmundsdottir who has worked so hard as our parent volunteer Uniform Coordinator over the last few years. She will continue to lend Sam a hand.
