If you fancy meeting up with Helen, our new Head Gardener, for a cup of tea, a biscuit and maybe a spot of light gardening (nothing scary!), why not catch Helen in the garden, in the playground, or by emailing her [hjrolph@gmail.com](mailto:hjrolph@gmail.com)&nbsp;to find out how you can get involved.
