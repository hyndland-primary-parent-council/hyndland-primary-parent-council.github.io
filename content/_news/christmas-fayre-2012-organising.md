Come along and find out about the biggest fundraising event of the calendar.

Last year the&nbsp;Christmas&nbsp;Fayre raised over £3300, which went towards playground improvements, fixing smartboards and many other things that benefit all the pupils at Hyndland Primary School.

Lots of people get involved in what is a great day.

We are looking for parents/carers who might be able to help organise the event, from sending out emails, or asking shops for gifts to sell, to helping out on the day.

Please come along to find out more, or if you have any new ideas for stalls.

If you are interested in helping out, but can’t come along to the meeting, please [email](mailto:alison.mussett@btinternet.com)&nbsp;Alison Mussett.

Christmas&nbsp;Fayre will be on Fri 7 Dec.
