It was with a tear in the eye and a lump in the throat that in Partick Bowling Club on Friday 26th August we said goodbye to one of Hyndland Primary School’s oldest relics, I mean much loved jannies, Janny Joe Cameron.

Joe was at Hyndland Primary School 21 years, man and, well, older man!

There was a fantastic turnout of staff, former staff, current and former parents of the school, as well as – probably most tellingly – pupils past and present.

On they day – and I believe well into the night for some! – ‘the Janny’ had more hugs than a newborn baby and more kisses than a Glasgow Fair weekender on Blackpool Beach with a ‘Kiss me quick’ hat on!

While asking that we “celebrate the life of Joe”, one particularly astute punter reminded the Parent Council Chair that “he wasn’t dead yet!”. The hapless Chair had meant to add “…at the school”, but the free-flowing beverages had clearly impaired both his speech and thought processes somewhat. Joe’s were somewhat more impaired than that by the time he had left the building!

It was both a sad occasion in that we were saying goodbye to Joe as the school Janny, but it was a lovely opportunity for all of his colleagues and friends that he’d made during those 21 years to share the day with him.

Good luck Janny Joe Cameron – Friend! Colleague! Legend! And very much alive!

Thank you to everyone who contributed to the Parent Council collection for Joe, which raised just under £400 (meal vouchers, fine rum and a brown envelope stuffed with…); those who gave him cards and gifts directly (of which there were many); and all those who turned up on the afternoon and into the early evening. Thanks also to the Headteacher Helen Brown and her colleagues for arranging the event and providing refreshments for all.

Joe asked the Parent Council to pass on his sincere and heartfelt thanks for all of the gifts, cards, hugs, kisses, kind words and support. He said that he has been overwhelmed.
