Common Health Challenge was launched the week the baton arrived, with children completing 3 events each week to gain a gold award at the end of the third week. If your child chose to take part and you havenâ€™t signed and returned the sheet to their class teacher yet, please do so by the end of the week so that they can get their Gold Award!
