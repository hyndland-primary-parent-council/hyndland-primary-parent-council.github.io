If you are interested in hearing about the activities of the Parent Council, come along to the&nbsp;**Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Wednesday 14th September, 7.00-8.30pm** in the school dining room. At the AGM you can hear reports about what happened last year, including ongoing playground improvements, garden, social events and music club as well as hear from the Head Teacher, Ms Brown, about school curriculum and activity developments, as well as the ongoing building works. If you are interested in getting involved there will be elections for new council members at the AGM. Everyone is welcome!

You are also welcome – and indeed urged – to attend any of the other Parent Council’s monthly meetings. The Parent Council is an important voice in the school community. It provides a forum for discussing developments in the school and ensuring that the perspective of the parents whose children attend the school is considered.

Much of the work undertaken in and by the Parent Council has funded a variety of things, including school folders, school buddy hats, PE/sports equipment, playground equipment, gardening activities, SMART boards, books, the outdoor classroom and other resources.

Additionally, each school year has a Parent Representative who you can contact if you have any ideas, questions, issues or concerns, and after the different years’ representatives and Chair are confirmed at the Annual General Meeting at the school on 14th September, we will let you know the contact names both in the Newsletter, and by updating the [Contact Us](contact-us/) page here on the Parent Council website.

In the meantime, there are continuing Parent Representatives who will be available for you to speak with. If you are unsure who your Parent Representative is and wish to discuss anything, please contact the Chair, John Lewis, at [john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk](mailto:john.lewis-hpc@hotmail.co.uk).

We will be looking for new Parent Reps this year, but would encourage you to become involved, as the Parent Council provides a great opportunity for you to keep abreast of what’s going on at the school.

Apart from the AGM, which is held in the school dinner hall, meetings of the Parent Council are held in the staff room and the dates this term are:

- Wednesday 14th September, 7.00-8.30pm (Annual General Meeting)
- Wednesday 12th October, 7.00-8.30pm (this date may change to Wed 26 October TBC)
- Wednesday 23rd November, 7.00-8.30pm

There is no meeting in December.

Go to the main door and press the buzzer for the Janny for entry.

Dates for next term will be published closer to the time.
