Easter Service Friday 4th April&nbsp;at Hyndland Parish Church at 9.45 – all welcome. &nbsp;For those of you who have not been before, you will be directed to the back three or four pews so as to allow room for the children to sit with their class in the front rows.

**If you are able to accompany a class to church please speak to your child’s class teacher.**

_Ensemble players are reminded to bring their instruments on Friday!_

**Thanks to Sarah MacMillan for driving the Djembes and music stands to church.**
