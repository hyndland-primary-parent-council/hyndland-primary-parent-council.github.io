**TL;DR:** Help fundraise for our school by signing up to [easyfundraising](easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/hyndlandprimary). A portion of your purchases through participating retailers is donated to Hyndland Primary. So far we've raised £2,846.28.

#### What Is easyfundraising?

It's simple: when you shop online through easyfundraising, retailers donate a bit to our school. It costs you nothing extra – the donation comes from the retailer.

#### How It Works

1. Follow the link and sign up at [easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/hyndlandprimary](https://www.easyfundraising.org.uk/causes/hyndlandprimary) 
2. Install the app on your phone, or the browser extension on your laptop - Donations only happen when you use the app or extension, so this step is crucial!
3. The app or plugin handles the rest when you shop!

#### Where Can I Use It?

Places you probably shop already, like:

- **Amazon** (up to £10 donation)
- **Tesco** (up to £6 donation)
- **Marks & Spencer** (up to 9% donation)
- **Argos** (up to 4% donation)
- **John Lewis, Just Eat, eBay, Booking.com** and many more

#### How We're Doing

So far our 110 supporters have raised £2,846.28. Every little helps – whether it's your weekly shop or a one-off purchase, it all adds up to make a real difference for our kids.
