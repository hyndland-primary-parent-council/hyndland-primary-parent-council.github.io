Big Thank You to all our parents too for your contributions and generosity at Christmas, proceeds from our Fayre are being translated into new Golden Time boxes of games/activities and Indoor Playtime Boxes (for when it POURS or is very cold!) to keep our children happy and stimulated at social times. The children met with teachers across the school to identify which resources they wanted per stage â€“ thank you boys and girls!
