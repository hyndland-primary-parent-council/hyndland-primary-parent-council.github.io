On Friday 2 December the Parent Council held our usual Autumn Ceilidh, which was a couple of weeks later than usual due to a combination of the new venue’s availability and also that of the ceilidh band.

However, while the turnout wasn’t as good as usual – which we think was largely down to its closeness to the Christmas holidays and clashes with parents’ staff Christmas nights out – it was as ever a lot of fun for children and parents and carers alike and is a great fundraiser for the Parent Council to help the school.

The event was organised by Nadia Miller and Wendy Jordan – thank you both for a great job! Special thanks also go to the many people helping out on the night through a large array of tasks, &nbsp;everyone who brought food, raffle and tombola prizes, and all of the parents and carers, teachers and children who attended.

This was the first time that we used Hyndland Community Hall as a venue instead of Partick Burgh Halls. Although smaller, the hall does take up to about 150 people (according to the convenor) and I think that we probably had around 70-80 in the night, though perhaps I might need to work on my numeracy skills!

Using this venue and a BYOB approach was a bit of an experiment, but the hall hire was £350 cheaper and, all things considered, we think it went well and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves!

On the night we took £581.45, of which £196.45 was profit after the hall hire, band costs and soft drinks were taken into account.

This is an excellent contribution to the work the Parent Council does to support the school.&nbsp; **Thank you to all of you who were involved in any way!**
