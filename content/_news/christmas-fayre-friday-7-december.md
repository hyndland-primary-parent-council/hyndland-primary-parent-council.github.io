### What happens at the Christmas Fayre?

The Christmas Fayre is on Fri 7 December this year and runs for the full school day.

In the morning the children come down a class at a time with their teacher and spend some time going round the stalls buying cakes, toys/books. From 1.30pm – 3.15pm parents and carers are invited to come along.&nbsp;You can pick up your children early from their class to go round the fayre with you if you want. A café runs in the dining hall in the afternoon selling tea, coffee, juice and cakes.

The money we raise makes a huge difference to the school. Last year the Fayre raised over £3,200 and over the year we raised around&nbsp;£7,000 in total. This helped fund playground improvements and teaching resources.

**Here’s how you can help:**

- Come along!
- Make a donation
- Volunteer to help out on the day

See below for a stall by stall guide to the type of donations you might want to make and for details of where to drop them off.

If you are interested&nbsp; **in volunteering** &nbsp;to help out on the day contact Linda McCormick [lindamccormick1@googlemail.com](mailto:lindamccormick1@googlemail.com)
