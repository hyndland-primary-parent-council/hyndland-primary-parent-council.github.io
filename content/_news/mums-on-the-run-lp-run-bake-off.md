Hyndland Mums on the Run is holding an LP Run and bake-off competition on Friday December 11 at&nbsp;9am. For those who have never done/heard of an LP run it works like this: the run takes place at a&nbsp;track and those taking part need to see how many times they can get round the track in 33 and a&nbsp;third minutes (hence, the LP tag!). The runners also run to the same playlist. Our track will be the&nbsp;West of Scotland Cricket Club and the playlist will be chosen by the MOTR mums. After the run&nbsp;everyone – runners and supporters – are invited back into school for coffee and a cake, and a vote to&nbsp;see whose home baking is the best of the bunch.

If you’d like to do the run (no skill required) or contribute to the bake-off (not necessarily any skill&nbsp;required) then please do! Contact Louise at [hyndlandmumsontherun@gmail.com](mailto:hyndlandmumsontherun@gmail.com) or follow us on&nbsp;Twittter ([@HyndlandMOTR](http://twitter.com/HyndlandMOTR)) for updates.
