[News](/news/), [School Garden](category/garden/)

Would you like to help out with the school garden but don’t have much time? You could adopt a plant pot. If anyone is interested in adopting a pot, please drop an email to Helen at [hjrolph@gmail.com](mailto:hjrolph@gmail.com) or find her in the playground and she’ll organise a pot for you. All you have to do is plant it up, decorate it if you wish, and put it somewhere around the school. You may want to plant some veggies or salad or flowers or do something more creative – it’s up to you. Your child can then enjoy watering the pot and picking the veggies/flowers when they are ready. You only have to focus on your pot, so if you are short on time, this can be a great way to still connect with nature. Many thanks to those people who have already adopted a pot.

_ **Thank you!** _

A big thank you to Daria and Eileen who have fixed the cold frame and also thanks to Morna, Carole and other parents who helped out with general watering duties and other activities around the garden.

Also, an even bigger thank you to all the children who have helped to dig the soil, do some planting and watering over the past few weeks – the school garden is there to be used and played in and it’s lovely to see so many children using it.

If anyone would like to take their children up to the garden after school, it is always open and there are always plants that need watering.

_ **FINALLY** _ – if anyone knows someone with a garden or allotment please let them know that if they have any spare plants and don’t know what to do with them, we’ll happily take them off their hands!
