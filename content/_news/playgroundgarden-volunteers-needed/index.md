**VOLUNTEERS NEEDED TO HELP OUT WITH THE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND AND GARDEN IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE EASTER BREAK**

School break is upon us – 3 potential weekends to carry out much needed tasks in order to improve playground areas.

However, on weekdays except for 13 & 14 April, work improving the playground and garden will still be ongoing (weather permitting); therefore, help during the week would gladly be welcomed too.

There is a list of tasks to be carried out – which range from general cleaning to painting…

If there is anyone out there happy to spare a few hours during the hols, please text 07882 942945 with the date(s) you’re available and the approximate time you can come along.

Please note the following:

If you bring along your children then it’s likely they’ll be painting too, so please ensure suitable clothing is worn.

We would like to see a big difference this year in all the playground areas and have some cracking projects for the kids to get involved in.

If your kids come along to help during the hols then they will become the ‘trailblazers’ and inspire their friends and classmates once school resumes with these projects.

Please also bring along spare paint, paint brushes, etc.

The Afty building will also be available for shelter/toilet/hot drinks while the holiday club children are away on outings – currently planned for the 5th, 7th, 11th and 13th. Any time between 10ish and 5ish.

Please come along and help out at some point during the holidays, even if it’s just for a couple of hours on a single day. The kids will probably love it too!
