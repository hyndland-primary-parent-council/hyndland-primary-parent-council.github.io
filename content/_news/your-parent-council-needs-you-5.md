Hyndland Primary School Parent Council is only as good as the support and involvement of those who contribute to it and the work of the wider Parent Forum. We are always looking for as wide a level of engagement with the Parent Council as possible, so please do approach Parent Council representatives with your comments, views and ideas and come along to the monthly meetings or email us at: [hello@hyndlandprimary.parent-council.scot](mailto:hello@hyndlandprimary.parent-council.scot)

**The next meeting of the Parent Council is on Wednesday 29 March 2017 at 7pm in the school staff room.**

Please come along and support us!
