**Tomorrow (Wed 6th) is the BIG DAY!** The mums will be heading off for their run at 9am… do come along and cheer them on.

The fundraising effort is going well and currently stands at £605. You can boost this further by donating in school or by going to the giving page:&nbsp;[https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/dcMX8](https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/dcMX8)

We’re also extremely grateful to Marco from Pizza Magic and Tabac for having one of our collection tins and also to Jellyhill who have done the same. We really value this fantastic support from local businesses.

Please feel free to share the online giving page on social media
