Just a wee reminder that the school Christmas Fayre is on tomorrow – Thursday 17 December – in the morning for the children and also from 1.30pm to 3pm for parents, carers and family.

The school has asked the Parent Council to request that children carry no more than £5 to school to spend at the Fayre.

When you arrive at the Fayre in the afternoon, you may pick your child(ren) up from their class to take around the Fayre with you and you can then take them home early as long as you sign them out with their class teacher.

If you have any items for the stalls, including any baked goods (no nuts please!), could you please drop them off at the main office at drop off time tomorrow (9am).

Please come along to the Christmas Fayre to buy some last minute Christmas presents, sample some home baking, meet staff and other parents and to help raise important funds for the school to use in our children’s education.

Thanks.

John Lewis  
Chair, Hyndland Primary School Parent Council
