Children in Scotland have been asked to write in to the Scottish Parliament’s Welfare Reform Committee to let them know how changes to welfare benefits are affecting families with a disabled child. They are carrying out a quick survey in order to get a better picture of families’ experiences. The survey will be open till the end of the month.
