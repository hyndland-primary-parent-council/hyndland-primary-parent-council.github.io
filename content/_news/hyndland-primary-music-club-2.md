Music Club, Mini’s and Ensemble will start on Monday 5th September. Thank you to everyone who has settled their fees. Any questions, please contact [naheedcruickshank@gmail.com](mailto:naheedcruickshank@gmail.com).

**A message from Naheed:**

Your child will start with choir&nbsp; **in the dining hall** for 30 minutes. Please remind them to go here when the bell rings.

After 30 minutes they will go to their instrumental lesson. There will be parent helpers to direct them to the appropriate classroom.

Pick up is from the playground at 4.20om prompt.

If they have a folder from last year, please remind them to bring it on Monday.

Best wishes

Naheed
