If there is anyone happy to water the garden and especially playground planters and pollination projects, trees etc., then could you please confirm by text to Susan Taylor on 07882 942 945 that you have done so, including what areas were done. If the plants and garden etc. aren’t watered regularly then there’s every chance that the forecast long, hot spell will start the process of desertification on Fortrose Street this summer.

On Sundays the school gate will be open from 11am – 1pm, but Janny John will be in the school on most days over the summer, and the Afty will be open, so access to the school grounds shouldn’t be a problem. Anyone is welcome to text Susan for info about what needs to be done, etc.
