Partick Burgh Halls, 7pm – 11pm

No advance ticket sales – TICKETS ONLY ON THE DOOR

Adult £4.00 &nbsp;Child £2.00

We’re improving the ever popular Family Ceilidh – keeping it a real family event for kids from P1-7. We’re retaining what everyone liked – the dancing, the raffle and the buffet – but with a few changes to make it even better.

The main difference is that we’re changing the raffle to give more time for dancing and socialising. The new schedule will be:

- 7pm – Doors open
- 7.30 – 8.15pm – Ceilidh
- 8.15 – 9pm – Food and Raffle
- 9 – 10pm – Ceilidh

#### BUFFET

Please bring along COLD food that can be eaten without cutlery. We don’t have any facilities to heat food up. Food that works well is crisps, easy to eat fruit, small cakes or pre-cut traybakes, pre-cooked and cut up pizza.

#### RAFFLE

As always please bring a raffle prize suitable for a child.

#### CEILIDH

We’re extending the amount of time for dancing so that you can all get the chance to have a dance with your kids.
