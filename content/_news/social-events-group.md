Fancy joining our Social Events group? The team who mastermind the quizzes, ceilidhs and other events in the year which give us a chance to get families together to have fun and support the school community. We’re looking for new ideas and fresh faces! Our next meeting is on Tuesday 5th March at 9pm in Cottiers. If you can’t make the meeting but would like to help out, or just want to find out more, contact Marie Tate marie.tate@ntlworld.com or Jane Grove janegrove@btinternet.com
