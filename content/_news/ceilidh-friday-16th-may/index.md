&nbsp;

**\*\*\* NEW BOOKING SYSTEM \*\*\***

New eco-friendly ticketless system! Book your place on the guest list by emailing Jane ([janegrove@btinternet.com](mailto:janegrove@btinternet.com)) with your name and the numbers of adults and children in your group, get a number for your envelope and post your money in the Parent Council box. You’ll also find Jane in the playground if you want to add your name that way. When you arrive at the Burgh Halls on the night, your party’s name will be on the guest list, along with your number. Think of all the trees we’ll be saving.

As usual, donations of child-friendly finger food \*\*\*NO NUTS\*\*\* for the buffet (let’s face it, as a grown-up you won’t get a look in!) and raffle prizes (preferably mostly for children) are always needed. Thanks in advance for whatever you are able to contribute.
