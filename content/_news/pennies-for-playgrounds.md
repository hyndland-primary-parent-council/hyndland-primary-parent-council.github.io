**There is still time to dig out your coppers and give them to the Pennies for Playgrounds project!**

Finally there is something useful to do with those annoying copper pennies that sit in the bottom of drawers or underneath the sofa.

The aim is to create some innovative low cost changes to the middle playground initially. If successful this will be repeated in the other playgrounds. A great way to create great places for play and get involved with the school.

**How to get involved!**

Send pennies to school for the buckets to help raise funds

Donate materials for the project (old tree stumps, pallets, buckets, plastic chairs, outdoor paint, tools etc.)

Get involved in the summer working bee (dates TBC)

Each class has a bucket to fill and the money raised will go towards our exciting new playground project that parents will be undertaking in a summer working bee. The buckets will be around until the end of term and every little counts!

We are working to get support from Community Safety Glasgow for donated labour & sourcing donated and recycled materials as much as possible. Fundraising will cover costs for materials that cannot be obtained by donation. Any leftover funds will be kept for repeating the project across all playgrounds.
