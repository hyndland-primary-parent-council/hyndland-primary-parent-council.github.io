Janny Joe retires from the school on Friday 12 August, just before the school starts back. Ms Brown will let parents and carers know of any farewell arrangements.

A collection for a farewell gift for Joe from parents will take place over the summer, with the collection tin available until Thursday 11 August in the Afty.

Let’s show Janny Joe our appreciation of the 21 years of service he’s given to the school and our children.

Thank you

John Lewis, Chair, Hyndland Primary School Parent Council
