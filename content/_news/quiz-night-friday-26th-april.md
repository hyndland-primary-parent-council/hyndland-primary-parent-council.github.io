Hyndland Bowling Club, Queensborough Gardens, 7.30pm

Tickets £5 – Adults only – get your sitter sorted!

**\*\*\*Oops! Not long to purchase your tickets! Hurry, hurry, hurry!\*\*\***

Hooray, at long last… a social event! Next week sees the return of our ever-popular Quiz Night. Regulars will know that it’s an opportunity to get together, have a drink, supper and a chat and maybe try your hand at a few questions if you feel like it. You can take it as seriously as you want… which tends to mean two or three teams vying for the trophy and the rest just along for a pleasant night out. Veteran Quizmaster Pat will be setting the questions… why not come along and try your luck.

If you’ve never been before, have a chat with a few pals and make your own team or come along on the night and we’ll find a group for you to join. Non-Hyndland parents & friends are also very welcome! P1 parents can speak to Linda (Katie’s mum) in the P1 playground to find out all about it.

Buffet Supper is included and we welcome any contributions, savoury or sweet, you would like to bring along. We’re also looking for Raffle Prizes. All money raised goes to help the school.

**Tickets can be purchased from Jane in the main playground&nbsp;** or by putting the correct money in an envelope marked Quiz Night along with your child’s name and class and posting it in the Parent Council box next to the school office. Cash or cheques payable to Hyndland Primary School Parent Council.
