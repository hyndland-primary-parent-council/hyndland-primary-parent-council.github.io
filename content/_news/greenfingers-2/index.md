[News](/news/), [School Garden](category/garden/)

As the holidays approach, we usually put together a watering rota for the school garden. If you are free to take your children down to the garden on a particular day or week over the summer to water the plants, please let us know as this will be a great help. The same also applies if youâ€™re able to come along and help out with playground improvements or gardening during the holidays.

Please email or phone either Helen Rolph ([hjrolph@gmail.com](mailto:hjrolph@gmail.com) / 07811 384083) or Susan Taylor ([matboffice@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:matboffice@yahoo.co.uk) / 07882 942945) if you are able to help out with the garden and playground work over the summer and beyond.

Very best wishes

_Helen and Susan_
