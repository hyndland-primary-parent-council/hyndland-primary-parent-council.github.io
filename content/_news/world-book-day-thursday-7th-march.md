Continuing the fun of Book Week, children are invited to come dressed as their favourite character from a book on World Book Day. Parents will also be invited along in the afternoon to visit the book fair to look at (and possibly purchase) books with their child.

Any parents, grandparents or friends of the family, authors, illustrators, story-tellers, poets etc. who would like to get involved with the celebrations on Thursday (tell us about your work, read a story, run a workshop with the children…) should contact Catherine MacQuarrie via the school office.
