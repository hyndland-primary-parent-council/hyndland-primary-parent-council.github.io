[News](/news/), [School Garden](category/garden/)

At Hyndland Primary we are keen to promote outdoor learning. The school garden is currently maintained by green fingered parent Helen Rolph, but she needs help. Would you be able to volunteer some of your time? She is always looking for volunteers to help out not just in the school garden, but with the playgrounds too. You could water the gardens and pots, help with planting, digging and preparing plants and seeds for classes.

If anyone is available to help out that would be great.

Helen will be looking for parent volunteers to help her with the gardening projects, so whether or not you are good with a trowel or can tell the difference between a plant and a weed, all-comers are welcome. If you are interested, please email Helen at [hjrolph@gmail.com](mailto:hjrolph@gmail.com).
