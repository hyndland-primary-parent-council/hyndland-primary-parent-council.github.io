Hyndland Primary School Parent Council is only as good as the support and involvement of those who contribute to it and the work of the wider Parent Forum. We are always looking for as wide a level of engagement between the Parent Council and wider Parent Forum as possible, whether that be funding ideas, ideas about improving the learning experience for the children at the school, social activities, and no doubt the many things we havenâ€™t yet thought of. So, please do approach or email Parent Council representatives with your comments, views and ideas and come along to the monthly meetings or email us at [enquiries@hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org](mailto:enquiries@hyndlandprimaryparentcouncil.org).

The next meeting of the&nbsp; **Parent Council is on Wednesday 2 November at 7pm** in the school staff room. This was rescheduled from 26 October.

_ **The parent voice is only as strong as the level of support it receives, so please get involved and come along and support us supporting the school to support our children!** _
