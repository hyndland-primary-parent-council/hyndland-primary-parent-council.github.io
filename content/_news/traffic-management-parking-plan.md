Glasgow City Council have now published their traffic management/parking plan for around the school and the wider Partick-Partickhill-Dowanhill area. You may have seen the notices posted around the affected streets. We’re interested in this from a road safety around the school entrances point of view and we will formulate a response and share it with you prior to the&nbsp; **consultation deadline of 8 March**.

The plans can be seen here: [https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=16995](https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=16995)

The proposals will also be on display in Partick Library between Monday 22 February and Saturday 27 February. Council officers will be in attendance at the Library on the following dates:

- Tuesday 23 February between 10am and 6pm
- Thursday 25 February between 10am and 6pm
- Friday 26 February between 10am and 5pm

Finally, please come along to the&nbsp; **Parent Council meetings** – the next of which is on&nbsp; **Wednesday 24 February at 7pm** – and contact me or any of your Parent Council reps if you have any queries or questions that you’d like to discuss. The Parent Council email address is: [hello@hyndlandprimary.parent-council.scot](mailto:hello@hyndlandprimary.parent-council.scot)
