The Quiz Night on Friday 24 October was a roaring success with £322 profit made on the night from ticket sales and raffle money. It was an evening of fun and some really hard and innovative questions developed by our new quiz masters, Linda McCormick and Anne Wood. Even the titles of the rounds were cryptic, so it really was difficult knowing which of the rounds to play the joker on. As it happened, the victorious team took a gamble and held their joker (double points) round until the end, where more points were already available than in the previous rounds. Proudly (or sadly, I’m not so sure!), Archie MacPherson’s Lost Souls stormed past the night’s ongoing leaders, Mums on the Run, to reach the finishing tape with a clean sweep of all of the questions on Glasgow boozers! Archie may have been lost earlier in the evening (he was, he was looking for Hughenden and ended up at Hyndland Bowling Club), but his namesakes certainly found their way in the end.

Lost Souls: from left to right, the winning team were Colin Forbes, Kirsty Jordan, Chris Watters, Helen Jordan, the Parent Council Chair John Lewis, Alan Bonnyman and Stevie Gallagher. The cans of lager were shared by all but the cup was taken home by Helen, to make up for all the previous last or second last places she’d previously been in.

Many thanks to all those who attended and also to those who brought food and raffle items.
