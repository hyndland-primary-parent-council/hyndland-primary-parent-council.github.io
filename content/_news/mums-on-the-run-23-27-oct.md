**This year Hyndland Mums on the Run are&nbsp;** raising funds to send each class at Hyndland Primary to Scotstoun Stadium to experience what it’s like to compete in a professional athletics arena: running on a real track, doing field events in a 5000-seater stadium, and using the same facilities as many of Team Scotland’s athletes. As a Glasgow school we get use of the stadium for free, but it costs £150 to pay for a bus to get the kids up there. Can you help? From October 23-27, Mums on the Run are getting their families and friends to get out and run a sponsored 5k to help pay for this amazing opportunity. Quite literally, we’re all running for a bus. Please sponsor us!

We have an online giving page here:&nbsp;[https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/6t4Ue/em/b22wx8](https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/6t4Ue/em/b22wx8 "Mums on the Run Fundrazr Page")&nbsp;or feel free to pass on a donation to one of our runners.

Hyndland Mums on the Run are:  
Louise Love, Pritha Mani, Ali Walker, Shireen Taylor, Carolyn Bonnyman, Charan Manak, Barbara McGinley, Lisa Logan, Marion Grant, Jane Chilton, Linda McCormick, Eileen Faulds, Morna Sigerson, Ailsa Grant, Helen Rolph, Vari McDonald, and Helen Newstead.
